welcome to my unboxing and first look at the Razer death adder twenty thirteen additional something I noticed about the death that are twenty thirteen is that it doesn't say twenty thirteen 
anywhere on the box at all in fact the only hint that this isn't a normal death matter than the packaging change and if you look really closely at the specs is razors marketing blurb here they say how do we improve on perfection very carefully we don't want to fix anything that wasn't broken and so we literally didn't change anything 
okay we focused instead on enhancing optimizing the does not realizing next generation technologies and further ergonomics freaks 
did they not find anything to detain stuff they did change stuff so I can get this baby opened up they went from a three point five G. sensor for forty cents or so they've increased the effective GPI and while the death adder has been and still is and optical gaming mouse as opposed to a laser gaming mouse and yes I know these things technically optical technology but that's not what most people mean when they say that they have they've still achieved a six thousand four hundred DP I arrange for this particular mouse which is very high for an optical mouse let's go ahead and open it up now they did a loop to some economics tweaks and so in addition to adding an operative sensor they have also made some slight changes to the shape of a mouse which does retain its right handed grip so you can see here this is not an ambidextrous ambidextrous most alternative a change to our table top here so that you guys can really clearly see what razors changed about the data twenty thirteen so it is still a right handed shape but you can see it's more subtle than many right handed my so there's an indentation on the side 
see the the the the more pronounced her there and then when you flip around to the other side 
you can see that it is a much less pronounced curving actually comes out a little bit so while a lefty could put their hand on the mouse the the and that their index finger would sit too low in their middle finger with behind it wouldn't be comfortable it is shaped for the right handed player now I have sort of small ish hands especially for male but I can harmless thing perfectly and then I have probably a little bit of odd looks like about a centimeter of space left or even if my fingers were bigger or if I curse my fingers a little bit I could have significantly larger hands while being able to pawn the most comfortably now we've encountered gaming mice that are upon grip type mouse but that are so small that you end up climbing them yeah unless you have little tiny little kid hands so that is not the case with the death of twenty thirteen now improvement that they have made that I think is huge is the addition of these rubber grips on the side so that is an extremely grippy rubber I don't know how to make that plea on film without side just kind of saying it guys it's awesome it has a nice texture to it so that you can you just by touching it lightly you'll be able to pick up the mouse without almost no effort note by not exerting almost any pressure on the most from the site at all this is great because it frees you up to have your mouse hand very relaxed and your wrist relaxed not causing any additional tension here but still being able to lift when you get to the edge of the mouse pad and there's another one on the thumb side as well so you can see that the way that they're shaped is optimized for the fingers that are intended to be pointed out them so this one's a little bit lower a little bit lower profile for the pinky and this one's a little bit higher profile without more of them occur in for the way that your family position now reserve because the buttons on this mouse hyper response buttons and I don't know if I would call the most real quick particularly hyper responsive nor would I call the front and back clicks 
particularly hyper responsive because they feel like normal buttons to me but the last of the right click feel like they're on a hair trigger so I would say yes those are definitely hyper responsive optimized for extremely fast button presses with almost no effort whatsoever so what makes an optimized for programming what's the difference between a pro level product and and a consumer grade products a lot of the time it's well how many times is a program to be pressing the button versus how many times is the typical consumer going to pressing the buttons are putting up the computer so that I can show you guys the lighting effects but I wanna see the bottom of the mouse as well so they've got 
now what they're calling their 
I ultra slick mouse feet so you can see there's one up at the top left one up at the top right and then another one down at the very bottom so razor doesn't give you any particular rating for how long these are supposed to last but it should be noted guys that actually doesn't matter if it was a huge surface area along the bottom of the mouse or a small one the coefficient of friction would actually be the same here's the four G. infrared sensor so precision sixty four hundred DP I many people don't use do you guys are about sort of the the the lower ranges but having the flexibility to be able to turn up your DP I and lower your mouse sensitivity in traffic celebration allows you to really tune the most use it the way that you want to use that sound here's the here's what the lighting effects looks like so you've got your eliminated scroll wheel 
I think that 
okay 
you've got your illuminated razor logo right here which apparently turned itself off and there we go so you can configure within synapse two point all the twenty thirteen addition does work Watson up two point %HESITATION which takes all of your gaming profiles and stores them in the cloud so you can use them where ever you happen to be as long as you log in at all store your profiles on a per game basis you can map your are you can map your commands however it is that you want to do that I want to make sure I didn't really miss anything here okay does support thousand hertz ultra pulling which is good arm a many gaming mice do that does support on the fly sensitivity adjustments and I think that pretty much 
covers it for what they had to say for themselves on the box itself I guess the last thing is just to show you that it is using a nice high quality braided cable 
so hopefully now that we switch to a white table top you guys going to be able to see that alright 
and thank you for checking out my unboxing and first look at the razor death adder twenty thirteen which they didn't change anything about what they did but they 
Donna whatever so looks to me like the things they change for good hole of note now that I've actually got the product out of the box because I had to look at it before box it does say twenty thirteen somewhere so there it is twenty thirteen is on the mouse itself even though it wasn't on the outside the box don't forget subscribe my detectives Fuhrman boxing's reviews and other computer video
