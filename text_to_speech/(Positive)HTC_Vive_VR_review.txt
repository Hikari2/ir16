uhhuh dnmt a month ago I tried the five pre a developer version of HTC and valve's virtual reality headset I clip unfinished and incredibly fun and I've been looking forward to the consumer version ever since now I finally got it in my hands and it's just as much fun but it still doesn't feel finished 
the vice gotten more polished since it was first announced last year but it's not a pretty piece of hardware the finished heads has almost identical to the five previous which is to say it's big front heavy and sort of industrial looking the print a couple of issues that seem totally fixable like the fact that it's foam facemasks hopes of sweat like a sponge 
but don't expect that to change on the five of course all the good things about the prayer here to the my box almost light unless you're looking straight down your nose and it's not too uncomfortable once you get used to a size although it's notably less comfortable than the oculus rift 
unlike the ref the vibe doesn't come with built in earphones art doesn't clued a pair of your body you can plug in but you'll probably want to use your own 
setting up the vibe involves a lot more than just plugging it in the bank uses your computer's HD MI and USB port 
just like the oculus ray 
but in between 
that there's a link box the 
plugged into a power 
and then there are the light house 
two laser towers the five uses to 
Hector position 
and I hope that this doesn't over balance and I'm going to try to put this tape on 
two I don't know either fig leaf of 
protection 
the lawyers are set up diagonally across the space you want to use 
anywhere from a box that's just big enough to stand up into a fifteen by fifteen foot room 
they don't need to be connected to your computer but they do need their own power supply so hopefully you've either got lots of outlets or lots of extension cords 
once you've got all this done to ready to set up steam VR a tool in valve's steam gaming platform 
given how complicated the vibe is Steve here is good at giving you feedback about what's working 
you can always see what's connected right on the dashboard and there's a simple calibration process that's even sort of fun 
I'm actually wait I forgot to run room set up through skill experiences you trees around the entire play space with a motion controller and Stevie are setup chaperone lines to match it 
all of that went pretty smoothly 
for the life 
it's very small for the live 
this will take some time but it's worth it as long as you're also find paying eight hundred dollars plus 
the gaming 
when everything works the five is the best experience you can happen via right this minute 
the screen is a little grainy but that's true of every had sat 
the field of you feel shaped a little different from oculus as 
the different doesn't mean worse here 
and later towers are incredibly forgiving as long as they're above you and pointed towards you the truck almost perfect 
a front facing camera can show you a rough outline of the outside world at the press of a button or whenever you move outside the vibes boundaries 
that's all great but there's one thing that really sets the by the park right now it's just about the only headset that lets you move around in the are 
you can use normal gamepads our mouse and keyboard with the five but most experiences are based around a pair of motion controllers that fit in your hands like remote controls 
I've got a few issues with them like the fact that it's way too easy to hit the home button under trackpad 
but the state away after you've used to control us for awhile 
they're also incredibly solid which is good because even if you never accidentally threw them across the room in a game of the art tennis the probably whacked the walrus and furniture at least a couple of times 
inside the are about the set up a lot of features you've got a full version of steam plus the ability to see your computer desktop and set a custom environment all around you 
the fact that I've already has a ready made platform is a huge benefit here they're already tons of people playing modding and selling a wide variety of games on steam 
the downside is that this can make everything sort of complicated 
your settings are spread out over lots of different menus and Stevie are itself still has plenty of glitches 
if you're already used to steam it's not too hard to figure things out but it's not a friendly system for newcomers 
which is too bad because the vibe shakes up all the usual stereotypes about PC gaming if you're creative non gaming tools like till brushing virtual desktop those nontraditional games like audio shield where you defend yourself against the notes of your favorite songs 
motion controls can feel incredibly fresh and intuitive and the super huge number of different experiences you can shoot guns zombies or you can solve plumbing puzzles to make tiny alien bear's happy 
there's something for almost everyone it can just be hard to find 
they can also be hard to find games and tools that aren't rough experimental or very short 
this is okay at first especially because you'll probably want to take breaks every hour or so standing up and walking around is more tiring than sitting image 
but after awhile I wanted something more substantial and my favorite experiences were clearly unfinished 
the vibe is where you go for cutting and virtual reality at least for the next few months 
but that also means that nobody has figured out exactly what to do with it whether you're talking about specific games and apps or its whole user experience 
by the time it's polished divides going to be competing with oculus which will support a lot of the same titles later this year 
before an early adopters had set the right does everything it ought to 
flexible functional available and often incredible 
%HESITATION god whatever you do
