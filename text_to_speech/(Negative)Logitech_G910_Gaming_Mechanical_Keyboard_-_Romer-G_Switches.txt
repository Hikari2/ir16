the days a lot attack rehashing the G15 slightly with every new gaming keyboard are over there last flagship refresh the G7 ten plus was a huge departure from the usual unless their first mechanical gaming keyboard featuring Terry mak switches and the G. nine ten one will be looking at today is a mechanical keyboard but instead of going with the industry standard cherry amax or can't get enough allocation of cherries standard kala they worked with omron on a new exclusive switch type Romer G. mechanical switches 
why not look to do nine ten will take your gaming to the next level watch on and not only have you got our BenQ twenty four inch XL twenty four twenty G. hybrid engine G. sync gaming monitor video coming soon lots of gaming stuff coming soon but for now the intro 
fineness 
from December thirteenth to twentieth two thousand fourteen you can save on select Intel CPUs knocks and SSDs with special holiday rebates from select retailers click now to learn more 
physical to our time this keyboard has everything a one hundred and four key layout with full anti ghosting nine extra macro ready programmable G. keys on the left and top of the WASD gaming area each of which can toggle between three different layers of funk 
a USB two chord with rugged stream protection media control keys in the top right including a rubberized volume real nice touch Logitech gaming mode to disable the windows keys back late toggle not one but two included wrist rests wonderful rubberized angle adjusters on the bottom African doc for your own decision so you can like seeing your peripheral vision while you're gaming and fall RGB LED backlighting on each key so that you can see that while you're gaming as well 
so let's start with the switches shall we water Romer G. switches exactly when they were created in partnership with omron so you can bet some science went into the development they feature a seventy million keystroke and during training a one upmanship efuture razor sixty million if I ever saw one they require forty five grams a for similar to cherry amex register very popular among gamers they actuate after only one point five millimeters of travel compared to cherry annexes ten millimeters they have a wider base for theoretically less key wobble although I found them comparable to a cherry annex keyboard with decent keycaps on it and they were made with backlighting in mind featuring a surface mounted RGB LED at the bottom for better reliability compared to keys which mounted LEDs and a light tube down the center of the switch for more even lighting and less spillover around the keys compared to cherry's RGB design found on the case seventy RGB 
%HESITATION okay Linus enough reading off Logitech site what do you think 
truthfully it took me awhile to decide they're just so different from anything that I've used before like rubber domes as you apply pressure they hold little hope a hoodlum Cinta collapse with mushy feeling but tactile sensation but I'm like rubber domes they don't need to be bottomed out to register a keystroke making this one of the most responsive keyboards I'd ever used and not just for gaming typing to 
so while hard core cherry amex enthusiasts myself included might not find the experience that satisfying 
especially if you like back crisp sound an annex blues and greens 
the performance is undeniable and for the majority of gamers out there who are still using rubber domes Logitech and on Ron have successfully engineered a much better up brain that will still feel comfortable and familiar so I consider the denying tens Romer G. key switch is a smashing success 
it's just too bad that Logitech paired them with the worst keycaps I've ever used in my life the very worst like not just all I guess they can tweak this and optimize that to make it better next time but like Logitech scrappy's Logitech calls these performance facet keycaps and instead of being gently curved to embrace your fingers as they pressed down on them they had this harsh and angular shape to them makes about as much sense to me as a shirt made out of square folded cardboard the idea is that they keep your finger centered on the keys and also improve performance when they're stuck on the edge this is meant to be beneficial for extremely high APM gaming but even now based on program gamer feedback they supposedly reduced the height of the riches once already I just found myself getting caught on them when moving quickly between chase some actually slow me down unless I take a higher less efficient path between keys and then to make matters worse they are learning that all the same making it really hard to get used to them the printing on the arrow keys and WASD I guess is designed to help you feel your way back without looking but it just feels weird on the fingers bending gaming half of the keyboard solo laughed gets three angle grooves while everything else gets tell you when I say everything I mean not everything because some random stuff like the left calf shifting control are mostly flat and no windows key is convex 
why on earth were they thinking 
and then the Supreme dealbreaker here is that because these aren't carrying makes keys which shows the stems are not compatible so you'll be good luck finding sensible replacements if you otherwise really like the G. nine ten what a shame 
because their stuff I really like about it I seem Logitech getting Flack about the arcs doc but as an original G15 user who isn't trying to cram a tablet or a phablet into it it's a welcome addition for me the hot does still need some work like I'm not sure who dark and put the tab switcher at the bottom where it's almost impossible to reach without gnashing your act he's but you can switch profiles monitor some rudimentary system in phone use your phone as a media remote and more importantly you can see notifications on your phone as they come in without paying like twenty Bucks for a phone stands a rocking Logitech and lower on the subject of rock and stuff aside from the media and profile he's being stuck orange and blue for some reason the RGB backlighting looks noon late on this keyboard even a stylized keys on the ones with words printed on them are really evenly lit and Logitech's software is easier to use than corsairs and includes a greater variety of lighting effects than razors did the last time I looked at it there's breathing with spin control a twinkling star affect with customizable colors a full spectrum color cycle with speed control configurable color waves that go horizontal top down or out from the center with speed control and a two color reactive typing well with speed control there's also no that shows the active gain keys while gaming depending on your profile another that allows you to set up different zones with different colors and finally freestyle mode which lets you set every kid a different color if you desire 
they've still got some work to do here other than sending a dimmer version of a color or turning the key in the back plate off entirely with a button there's no brightness control and you can save and recall favorite freestyle designed without manually recreating them and lighting can't change on a per profile basis but it's a very decent starting point it got time to fix those things 
and that's what I think the G. nine tennis it's a starting point for Romer G. switches which I think have a very bright future 
once they're surrounded by a keyboard that isn't let down by other poor design choices which reminds me I haven't even talked about the wrist rest yet Logitech includes two wrist rests in the box but instead of having like that stylized Hamer was with a nice wide resting area on a from the left hand and then nothing for the right and then a symmetrical one since most of the gamers I know also type from time to time it's nice to have both rests on the rest rest they include two different sized tamer ones 
idea 
speaking in different sizes are you sick of having to select a specific size for your phone plan before you know how much you're actually going to use if so you might wanna check out taking a mobile service provider in the U. S. that has a great December promo going on right now so from now until January fifth if you break your other contract to switch to tame they will cover fifty percent of your fee by giving you up to a hundred and fifty Bucks per device in service credit this is double their normal offer to cover twenty five percent of your fee now considering that their average monthly bill per device is twenty six dollars that could be a pretty darn significant savings for you and if you have a referral link that's Linus dotting dot com you can actually get another twenty five dollars and service credit or twenty five dollars towards a new device so check out ten and try out their savings calculator because you don't have to commit to switch until you've already determined that you'll save money you enter your last three bills and spits out how much you would be paying on ten and as long as you've got been sprint service in your area and that's the network they're running on then we'll be having well good tell service and you'll be paying less for it
