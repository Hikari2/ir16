nnova with guys engaged here and this is the iPhone six S. now know it might be a little bit hard to tell the difference between the six and six S. at first glance so this video is everything need to know that is new and different about the app on success first of all the design so on the outside the designer means nearly the same not identical but obviously super familiar for iPhone six users for those of hot guys who noticed the iPhone six has all the FCC markings on the bottom and no es badge than the six S. came out after you are no longer required to have the SEC markings so they got rid of them and it looks a little bit cleaner though the S. bags I guess looks a little bit out of place anyway the main way to actually be able to tell if someone has a new iPhone is if they have the new pink color 
you mean road school right 
I it's it's pink 
dude it's rose gold it's like a pale faded version throws call 
alright it's rose gold anyway the real difference on the outside is that apple is now using a seven thousand series aluminum which makes for a stronger body which means it won't bend is easily even reinforced internally around the volume buttons word bent last year you can't see that but it's there overall though button placement headphone Jack mute switch etcetera all the stuff is in the same place 
still I also have a rounded shape of last year and I've said this before the rounded sides make it a bit slippery in hand so you already know what to do although something to note this new iPhone is thicker taller and wider than the iPhone six so your cases and skins from last year probably won't fit depending on how precise there when my favorite changes though on the front of the new iPhone is in you touch ID this new fingerprint sensor is ridiculously fast some might even say too fast it's fast to the point where if you wake up your phone unlock it with your finger on the home button you might actually miss the notifications that you could have read on your lockscreen which is pretty funny because you can basically unlock touch ID 
just a tap now in not holding the home button you can just touch it and read your fingerprint that fast 
the work around of course to not being able to read or notifications or just check the time would be to use a different finger to check that or resort back to that trustee sleep wake but so the next big upgrade with the iPhone six S. is on the inside 
specs so in the three DS first came out apple said lasted for speed technically heaven said anything since then so I'm going to assume the S. again stands for speed because this phone is insanely fast talking apples knew a nine ship technically a dual core chip but two very powerful chorus near two gigahertz and two gigabytes of ram which is plenty for iOS as we know so multitasking is great it keeps more apps in memory now longer than they did before in overall dated a performance is super snappy frame rates are consistently high obviousness this phone for weeks so it's not just a brand new phone being fast 
apps open and close really quickly and performance throughout is top notch of the success drop some insane scores to indeed bench on par with some laptop so that gives you any idea this phone is blaze now there is one aspect it's actually technically worse than it was before and that's the battery on paper you have to have technically a slightly smaller battery in these new iPhones than you did in the previous so the iPhone successes down to seventeen hundred fifteen million powers and I found success plus down to twenty seven fifty the battery life however is still about the same meaning the iPhone six S. battery is okay will probably last you a full day normally but heavy days you might find yourself needing to plug in before the end of the day but the iPhone six S. plus battery is really good that's one of the benefits of a bigger found the success plus is one the best battery life in any smartphone has awesome stand by time meaning you can forget to charge it at night and not have any worries and I failed to kill it in a day so I'm more than happy at the end the day ending with twenty to thirty percent battery life even after normal or heavy use now the next main thing that's changing the iPhone success is the display now the panel itself is still the same it'll still look the same at thirteen thirty four by seven fifty IPS panel on the iPhone six S. and attended the P. LCD on the success plus but the display now has an extra hard work to make it pressure sensitive apple because it three D. touch and it's basically the iPhone's biggest new feature now called three D. touch not force touch because it has multiple layers of pressure sensitivity and that's what allows for what apple calls peek and pop nobody actually because at that but that's what I was naming its own an act that supports three D. touch if you see something you like you can press into it with a bit of pressure to peek to see what it is and if you like what you see you can press even harder to pop into that thing 
to view it full screen and that's the essence of pecan pop it's not just a long press see can actually peek into something and then decide that's all you want to see and you can release it to minimize a back 
you can also three touch on the home screen so apps that support it review a quick shortcuts to functions inside them when you press with some pressure 
and couple of apple app support this to start if you third party ones are doing this to you and with a little practice you can kind of get to remembering where certain functions are in a short cuts you can actually get it to do what you want to do a little bit quicker works pretty well now but we have to remember this is still pretty early for the new iPhones 
and a lot of the apps that we use today aren't supported by treaty touch 
developers however are getting on that and when developers building three D. touch functionality in a meaningful way into their apps it'll start to build out and it'll be a lot more prevalent throughout the whole OS so again right now when it's early it seems a little bit excessively gimmicky but will become very poor in the future went up isn't supported and you try to three D. touch the icon on the home screen for example you have to engine gives you this quick trip a buzz and blurs the edges letting you know there's nothing to see here so you kind of figure out which apps have three touch functionality and which don't in a matter of just going around and pressing all the apps on your home screen into a final good ones overall I think three touched pretty cool but again it will only get cooler in time thanks to developers of the last but not least new thing on the iPhone success is the camera the phone is rocking a new twelve megapixel sensor seem flashing mostly the same optics everything just a new sensor within you specs to back it up I have taken a lot of photos with my iPhone 
excess plus probably because you know I'm testing it and it's a new camera but also because I phones consistently like encourage taking photos became interface has been that some of the best balances of control and ease of use in any smartphone my 
and so I love the app is super fast and responsive and easy to take a great photo so I phone six S. plus also benefits from having optical image stabilization so low light photos are a little bit cleaner and video looks a lot smoother so here are the photos and I'm so you're not going to notice like a whole ton of difference in detail getting twelve megapixels verses eight but most of the improvements are gonna notice actually see in the colors and the image processing not a whole lot of sharpening going on but there's still plenty of detail throughout the frames anger probably noticed colors are kinda warm throughout like every scene 
and it's actually pretty natural and a good representation of the actual subject as opposed to sort of cooling off the colors which might look a little better at first but is less accurate it handles exposure great and dynamic range is pretty good sense HDR is never really too aggressive since its auto HDR and seem thing and low let you start to see a little bit annoys as you would expect but overall nothing too crazy here and again this is pretty much all just walk up to the subject point and shoot now jumping from eight megapixels to twelve now means the iPhone finally has enough pixels to shoot that four K. video I love so much and the video from the sensor is beautiful as expected now if you're serious about shooting a lot of video on the iPhone you pretty much have to go success plus to get that optical image stabilization but yet more of the same characteristics show up here detail without being overly sharp and great exposure and dynamic range will not blowing things out an actor colors with warm tones all the way through is also new feature in the camera this year called life photos and I've tried really really hard to give us a chance and see if it's not a gimmick but it kinda is basically live photos which are enabled by default captures one and a half seconds before and one half seconds after you press the shutter button for every picture and you can even see the live indicator while you're capturing after you get the shutter button 
so you can sort of view that short Jeff with sound by three D. touching the photo you just took and seeing the lead up to the shot and then what happened right after you can be cool every once in awhile like being able to see something blowing in the wind or capturing the lead up to a photo or what happened right after you click the shutter I don't know my wife photos of probably do a more interesting if I was taking pictures of more dynamic things like people have been instead most of mine are just picking the camera up 
and then putting the camera back down usually back into my pocket so there's an update coming to prevent this from happening by having the iPhone read excel rounder and gyroscope to know when you stop holding your phone up but yeah that's pretty much it for life photos there's no way to share them you just share the normal picture and all you have to do with them is set them as a wallpaper or make them your apple watch face basically have come to the conclusion that live photos are just a really big beautiful demo for three D. touch and that's fine it's enabled by default they take up the space of two photos instead of one so not a big deal with storage any other way to view them is with a three D. touch so learn it three D. touch is going to be important really soon that's it that's everything that's new with the new iPhone success 
%HESITATION is running iOS nine and if you're already using a previous iPhone you're probably already very familiar with iOS nine so I need to tell you about the slightly new font or the slightly worse multitasking carousel in my opinion %HESITATION Yuri familiar with the experience if you're not coming from an iPhone you might be interested in the six asks for its blazing fast performance and ease of use and awesome camera my biggest problem with it is 
sixteen gigabytes really 
about with four K. video and live photos everything like that Aceves twenty fifteen were pretty much done with that succeeded phones need to die and it's not just apple everyone stop anyway that's been it I guess let the hype train begin for the iPhone seven I thank you for watching this review video if you enjoyed it to free hit that like button down below and have any comments or questions opinion on the comment section below we can chat there as well thanks for watching I'll talk to you as the next one
