made for mobility 
built for business 
that's always been blackberries mantra in house the blackberry playbook students that 
well the answer's badly very badly 
first let's talk about software 
the blackberry playbook is running its own proprietary tablet operating system 
based on QNX 
which in theory works quite well 
you can slide down from the top of the screen to get your system settings 
and you're more immediate actions and settings are placed Europe the top 
you can also place your more important starting at the bottom 
and tapping on this aero brings up the after 
tapping on apposite full screen 
once you're in now you can pull down from the top to get the absent earns 
sliding up gets you to your multitasking if you 
this is probably one of the most interesting and unique parts that work very well 
unlike other tablets running iOS android them water task like quick app switching and saving your slot for a period of time 
this town would truly wanted to 
when you slide in from the left or right edge of the screen 
you can get your other apps they're running alongside the app you have full screen 
as you can clearly see the camera yeah hasn't paused 
still running in its full form 
it's pretty close to desktop mobile multitasking 
we should be awesome if their aunts were running 
with that let's talk about the weakest part of this that what software Yap's 
the apps on the blackberry playbook arts you and number in the biz loan quality 
if you were German apps in the platform our old slow and missing features 
the facelift after instance 
rex functionally with a lot of things new see as just terrible use 
the only answer I think you would actually look for I was able to find 
or Twitter 
you version 
and what 
all of which were painfully slow and haven't been updated in years 
now besides those apps I was able to find your mother fun games 
and beyond that it's all just fan 
we're ninety percent the apps on the platform were mixed inflict terrible nonfunctional and stamina 
funny bone just didn't work 
with that let's start with the hardware 
probably the most annoying part about this tablet is the tiny depressed near her to reach power switch which only reacts that half the time 
you can also unlock the tablet by sliding up from the palm screen 
which would be fine if the gesture weren't so inconsistent 
with that let's talk about the screen 
the screen is definitely below average but it's workable 
other tablets today tend to have bigger screens 
because seven inches 
it is pretty close to what we're doing larger funds 
now for the processing power 
Mr will seems to run the playbook OS just fine but it's clear that there wasn't much if any overhead 
apps and even a keyboard have a hard time keeping up with the taps and swipes 
that your user will do 
and in many apps such as the browser performances pretty pitiful 
any websites can take upwards of thirty seconds to fully render and once they do navigation is still slow 
beyond that the cameras are serviceable but the battery life was pretty abysmal 
rarely can I get more than two days stand by time and I can only muster about three hours of string on time Max 
which is less than half of our town 
no sooner wrap this up 
but where very playbook software as a lot of good ideas 
they're executed poorly 
and then besides that there isn't really much faster say the apple store is filled with terrible apps 
the performances 
terrible and the battery life is atrocious 
if you're thinking about this buying this tablet just do yourself a favor 
don't
