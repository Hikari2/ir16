it's probably one of the biggest smartphone releases of the year and it's certainly one of the most anticipated Samsung is storing everything it's got into its newest flagship release 
so does it live up to all of the hype a charge of a governmental authority what's going on everybody and yes this 
is the Samsung galaxy 
as for 
leann the Samsung galaxy S. four follows up the tremendously popular galaxy S. three and hopes to not only please those loyal to the line but also to entice anyone who has held up until now 
the design of the S. four is largely derivative of its older counterpart especially in the white model you have the white bezel shrunken down to accommodate the five inch screen flatter sides 
and a different layout for the rear camera and speaker 
otherwise the blatantly out is just about the same as it was on the S. three 
the back cover is still removable you not only get access to the SD card slot and battery 
but you can even buy excess recovers like the smart cover or the wireless charging cover for added functionality 
but the phone continues Samsung's trend of plastic bodies and covers 
it may be a material choice that is starting to get old but none the less anyone who has used a es three in the past will feel right at home here 
let me reiterate that 
the Samsung galaxy S. four feels pretty much like its predecessor 
while the general aesthetic might be getting a little played out remember that there is so much improvement everywhere else and yet it is actually smaller than the S. three with the same height the as four sheds a fraction of the estrous thickness and is even a little bit narrower most important here however is that the S. four is even lighter though it might only be three grams lighter there is a balancing to the galaxy S. four that makes it feel like a feather 
you can definitely call that a victory the design department as this is the best handling five inch screen device out there 
shortly after receiving this unit I was able to text chat browse and play with one hand comfortably the flat side to make the phone easier to grip with their fingers and palms 
any ham gymnastics typically needed for a five in screen or at the least required when using this phone only rarely did I need to use my other hand to reach the very top left corner of the screen 
perhaps the most obvious improvement at first glance is the display Sampson brought their super analytic up to a five in screen capable of ten eighty P. resolution and four hundred and forty one PPIs 
the result is one of the best displays on a smartphone period not only is it easily viewable in almost any condition it is also capable of some very steep viewing angles 
the uber colorful touches you I benefits from the screens high saturation 
making colors pop out and basically punch you in the face 
reading anything on the screen is easy to as text is incredibly sharp 
move under that screen and you'll find that the galaxy S. four is among the fastest phones around it has the quad core snapdragon six hundred processors that is only currently found on about a few other devices and is a big leap from the S. four pro 
it is not the Exynos octa core that we may have heard about but this process or package definitely included in north American models is still an incredible performer I was zipping through all elements of the U. why and multi tasking with no problems 
a few tests in antutu benchmark put the galaxy S. four right around the very impressive twenty five thousand mark 
exited outputs the tried and true Adreno three twenty performance at very high ratings and the two gigabytes are available for all of your multi tasking pleasure 
hardware is what the Samsung galaxy S. four hasn't spades 
the speakers no front facing boomsound but it is quite loud and is far from tinny 
well 
nnj 
nnj for them now only sporting expandable memory and a replaceable battery but a host of new sensors and utilities for a bunch of uses 
first one will list is a IR blaster capable of controlling a host of TV's setup boxes and players 
GPS wifi and Bluetooth are your standards while NFC with SB makes its return 
but there are many sensors at in that complement the typical accelerometer and proximity sensor you now have a barometer and a temperature gauge to check the general conditions around you an RGB light sensor that helps adjust the color and white balance of the screen based on its detection of light 
an infrared sensor for all hands in air gestures and a whole sensor for detecting closed smart converse and finally a compass 
what is perhaps best about these additions as that software inclusions make them all useful in one way or another but we'll get to that soon 
the battery unit included with the S. four is of a higher capacity than most five inch screen device offerings twenty six hundred mil and ours are able to power this phone for quite awhile making the end of the day a little less precarious for the common user 
with a bit of a robust test using wifi and Netflix movies the phone finally knocked out at right under the four hour mark 
otherwise straight browsing time and playing videos from memory certainly came in at impressively long times 
usually around eight or so hours on wifi without disabling sink 
it is definitely among the longest lasting five inch screen devices available and with the ability to replace the battery when it finally runs out of juice you really shouldn't have any power issues on the galaxy S. four 
improvements on the camera start off pretty standard thirteen megapixels are what you get this time around while the front facing camera gets to 
additions are all in the application itself in which there are now a bunch of new ways to use those optics 
once you may expect include best face which takes a burst shot and allows you to replace detected faces to find the right one you need for the shot 
animated photo which just basically take cybershot and creates animated gifs from them 
true out 
sounded shocked 
EGR and panorama 
you are also able to use both the front and rear facing cameras in order to create a dual shock picture or video 
now the big additions take further advantage of those burst shots via racer mode and drama shot 
research detects the objects that move aside from your subject and background and erases anything not meant to be in the picture 
drama show instead adds the moving subject on top of the stable background creating a nice looking one picture burst subject 
both are nice to use as long as your device and the general background are stable 
picture called in the us for is really quite good just as the S. three was considered a great performer in the eight megapixel space the S. four is among the best in the thirteen megapixel space 
you get a great deal of detail and the colours shut saturation is high enough to make any picture nice and vibrant 
with great quality and a host of voice to take a picture of the galaxy S. four is definitely at the top of the list of smartphone cameras 
and finally we get to the software 
TouchWiz is an android you either you either love or hate personally I've never been a big fan of its more bloated and yet uber colorful look though the great quality of the screen certainly helps make those colours really go nuts 
but this time around with the jelly bean four point two point two powered version of Samsung's you I I actually didn't immediately replace it with a different launcher 
while that might happen eventually I have found why it is more tolerable this time around 
the size of the screen 
high resolution displays often run the risk of making things uncomfortably small or weirdly spaced out but the already and large and bloated touch was M. elements translate perfectly to the ten eighty P. display 
what you get is an easily accessible interface that even with the smallest font size 
it's simple to navigate without having to squint to pinpoint 
there are a number of new ways to get around in built in applications 
it might be a little daunting to look through all of these but a large power which in the notification drop down gives you a quick glimpse 
there are motion features that return like direct calling which caused the contact currently displayed automatically when the phone is brought to your face or muting when turning your phone over onto its face 
a sensitive screen allows you to get around even when wearing gloves as well as use your finger like an ass pan to get quick previews of gallery albums 
I think the most practical application of this interview is previewing your last received tax 
and then there are all of the different air gestures that take advantage of the motion sensor 
you can jump through a web page 
go to the next picture 
change the music track 
my favorite one is a quick info screen that pops up after you wave your hand 
it's a brilliant way to quickly get the time date and notifications of missed calls and texts 
quick tip though you some finesse 
the center has to pick of the movement for the gesture to register so you don't have to do so fast 
smart screen capabilities utilize the front facing camera to detect if you're still looking 
the screen will stay on as long as the phone is at an angle and eyes are still on the screen 
smart pas will pause a video playing when you look away 
I personally like the smart school 
let the phone detect your eyes after which you can slightly tilt your head to look at the bottom or top of the screen which will scroll a web page accordingly you just ought to take that extra second or two to allow the phone to do 
her eyes 
new apps included on the S. translator which allows for voice and text translations among about a dozen different languages 
story album which put your pictures together in an ice flip book format and group play which allows you to connect to a bunch of other as for devices to share pictures documents presentations and music 
while I don't have other units to demonstrate this right now I can say it is a really cool feature especially when you have five total devices put together and make every single one play one of the five channels of music 
and finally there's as health perhaps the biggest endeavor 
if you've ever used multiple diet or exercise tracking applications Simpson has tried to consolidate them all into as health 
you can track food from a database or from information you add in yourself track physical activity log weight and even use the thermometer and barometer to check humidity and temperature of your surroundings 
the gyroscope in the as for can also be set on for tracking your steps 
if one is in your pocket wanna put it took some work still 
all of these features will be further augmented with a number of accessories you can buy like a heart rate monitor arrest predominant and await scale 
it's actually a nice suite of diet applications that can help anyone who gets into the habit of tracking to get into shape 
to end we have the price the Samsung galaxy S. four should be coming out on pretty much all major carriers most of whom have already posted preorders 
in America it will be around two hundred with a two year contract while the un carrier T. mobile plan will ask for one fifty up front with twenty dollar device payments each month for two years 
with the galaxy S. four slated to come out on just about any carrier you will be able to get your hands on one no problem 
unlike prices will likely get around the seven hundred dollar U. S. mark 
and so there you have it 
I will say this Samsung put a lot of work into making sure their us for offers the most to its users 
all of the centers give many ways of performing tasks we've gotten used to doing with just our fingertips 
other features like group play in the camera additions are neat tricks that are fun to use once you find a time to use them 
N. S. health will help anyone per active enough to use it 
and that's about the gist of the life companion Samsung galaxy S. four 
it may not be particularly revolutionary but it does get close to perfecting what is already in place 
while giving a new alternative ways of how to do that 
you're given choices on how to tackle pretty much any typical task 
and if you don't wanna use those particular features well you really don't have to 
but just like Samsung the company itself 
it's all there for you and one day you just might end up trying it out serendipitously or even out of sheer boredom 
and then before you know it 
you fall in love
