okay they first start this review I I have to make one thing crystal clear it is a request that mines all watching this video 
what if you do do not buy this game 
Alex well why not base nd 
uhhuh 
so they ought to eighteen eighty six is a new third person cover shooters from ready at dawn and sunset Monica studio both being pretty damn reputable developers having worked previously together on the well received PSP versions of court of law so again like the other eighteen ninety six is a benefit Apache follow them but it's still being one of the very excited to play 
and mostly because the previews I saw because I just can't tell you what you know already this game looks phenomenal I mean you can tell immediately from a storage I'm showing you about how dumb go this game looks right it's incredibly cinematic with fantastic text you work and impeccable acting began verges on photo realistic times 
also there is literally no difference and graphics between cutscenes and gameplay and the way the transition between the two was so good I don't mean even realize what I could see them ended the voice acting in motion capture also top notch won't makes this all doubly impressive is how I don't know load times in the anti gay I mean you guys the all aged eighty six truly shows as well that he has talked to do when a graphical while how they can be in sixty frames per second instead of the locks in thirty not what it made the game look even better book because the graphics are so good I didn't really mind 
now I'm talking about the skins presentation face because I just wanna get the obvious out that way at the game looks is good ingame as it in the previews the presentation Asia's overall fantastic 
the rest of the game however is pretty %HESITATION 
annnnd 
okay let's look at the story began takes place in a dystopian Victorian London what the centuries the human race is lived amongst half breed monsters what should not meant live to easy for your average Joe by these monsters is an art of nights one of which the guy you play astral gracing Galahad ideology to kick some ass with your fellow nice ideas in undercover conspiracy that shape of the very thing understands fall now if there's ever been a game that was all buildup and no payoff at the art eighteen eighty six is that game I first glance these characters look pretty interesting are mammograms and me in this chick on this French guy for the first time I don't know yeah that could be a controller camaraderie between these three that could be so interesting character acts and some and stand back and forth bouncer this story could be pretty damn good 
but unfortunately if all shots 
the characters had potential but we have developed enough to really care about them 
that's how one or two moments to give these NPCs some personality but they're few and far between and when bad things happen I really didn't catch just give an example that's a character that dies about halfway through the game and they were really trying to make a big deal out of it you know what with the 
sad violin music and all the characters going are Meryl you learn more sees lives there and he and the character that died I knew nothing about I could remember his name I'll tell you anything about him 
so yeah begins carrot is a pretty forgettable sci was hoping that the narrative of make up for the games like personality buzzing place through I kept waiting and waiting for the story picco I kinda sensed every now and again okay this is where the game is going to really began this is why the classic encounters inform character interactions are being wasted far gonna happen five hours into the game the stuff we did get a little better 
she was going down pieces were moving pretty intriguing same weather story was going to go by this point plot elements had been explained better as there is a distinct lack of any kind of explanation in the beginning of the game as to what they are actually status I felt quite confused at first well things were explained that it was the story went on I began to moderately enjoy the narrative book things took a turn for the worse when I reached the six hour mark of the game 
I just finished this past fall and I was watching a cutscene and I was thinking okay now once you get the bad guy and make amends without belemnites let's go kick some are asked and give while also the villain bring on the next level 
and %HESITATION what did I see next 
the volcano and credits 
guys my jaw just dropped slightly lecture really draws I wishes sat there playing my game with controller in hand and I was like 
I couldn't believe that we dnmt there was so many plot threads left hanging he honestly felt like half the story he's as if the developers will like I well we met again lasted barely possible 
six hours show the star is incomplete but well just know all that sequel that way we can make more money 
the ending is inexcusable is also the biggest pokies all of pay full retail price for the game this is why I said Dr bias a six hour again that ends this abruptly and doesn't even have a multiplayer component is not worth it sixty dollars it's not the ending that really left a bad taste my mouth guys that's a real shame because the story wash showing promise bulldozed and credit just pop right blackout it no way is honestly the worst ending to a game I played in recent memory I played last I think three the ending just made me visualize what people's reactions would be at the parking out for it Kuwait for this game has a habit and after only six apparatus and so horrendously at back and it's not as if there's any replay value I mean I can't imagine anyone wanting to play through the campaign for a second time a lot of anything to do was the game beat makes this game horrendous value for money now maybe I could just buy these games asking price if the gameplay could make up for the shitty ending though 
really does 
you ever play any third person cover shoot from the past five years yeah well then you place the order aids maybe six is basically actually version of uncharted sprinkled with a bit of resident evil fall much like uncharted you won't mention your way through various stages but everything feels clone here in all limited 
shooting is fine actually pretty fun with some cool unique weapons to use though is handled by the developers insistence on playing black box at the top and bottom of the screen 
the idea behind it is meant to give you a more cinematic book twenty one by nine aspect ratio does not make something like a movie Alice countless films do it V. anyway so why should this 
the blast really limit your field of view especially Germany or encounters with the like it beasts 
while they're very difficult to spot as they charge run past you other problem persists when facing humans because of an enemy is Bob you don't forget it you will be able to say here now in terms of difficulty it's %HESITATION moderates 
the biggest challenge you welfare side enemies which roshi workshop going to tax 
and these are texting tend to feel that way chic %HESITATION aspect Illinois thank you players now to help out the old age ninety six as to unique their mechanics 
well unique page 
one is one of you lose all your help you can drink a vial of what is called black water to revive you 
think the power of Wolverine in a ball pretty Mexico useful is also an option to slow down time and take out enemies behind you automatically lock on them and then you can shoot accordingly dnmt 
well they feel pretty underwhelming 
I would have preferred a red dead redemption system why you would pinpoint way one issue manually and then with a clickable and shoot them all really quick 
that system was they share 
if however it feels ineffective in your gut you living habits 
then there's like platforming here and everybody feels very scripted a linear these moments are here basically just the stretch the wrong time melee attacks are also pretty now where all you have to do is push the triangle ball and when you're knee of anatomy addressable do the rest 
there's no problem non combat system here is just overly simplified and it's a bit share and finally there's a stealth sections but again if there's quite clunky grass interest doesn't move the quick impact but neck and dragged us and stealth kills can get pretty infuriated many stupid QuickTime pro decides not to work 
well you 
owner speaking of quick time events %HESITATION they're everywhere bullet surely the first thing you do in this game is a quick time events 
whose idea was that 
whoever it was you need to be fired immediately cutesy Eastham Paul may not challenging the insult your intelligence every time they've Papo off walk you may not have to push forward to golf ball dnmt 
so the shooting is average the platform my as well because of the cut scenes the stealthy shit on the quick time events are quick time events 
so does the game over anything else 
mt not really hot from that there's only some gameplay states where you walk around in a very linear game world and then 
look at things 
and quite possibly the most confusing of design choices for this game is actually part of the story where Grayson take something off and then they give asks you to move the analog stick can be so you can locate a 
truly we live in a privileged age of gaming 
that's also various newspaper clippings and photos to take Kabul than ever of any interest on the boring audio logs just made me think back to that bit from sap acoustically truth 
so hungry I searched for a vote but the only thing I've found other people that knowing is this audio dogs why do they bother when they clearly were in terrible danger shoddy lock I find is more irrelevant barring than the last I must keep looking for a way to survive so in conclusion guys the all eighteen ninety six is that by the numbers shoots under the guise of a very pretty one I really have to commend the game's visuals but great graphics does not make a great game the narrative has some good moments and the shooting is entertaining enough but the game's ending but I still can't get over that I was looking up listening to semi promotional copy of the schedule review if you guys 
but if I spent full rate Telmex Hageby test 
but I have to review this game is if I did because that's what most people are going to have to do with anyone play this if you can't get enough of that person shooters autograph pics complain big pot and your enjoyment of the game then I recommend giving this game Iran's 
I cannot stress enough how this is not worth it purchases I experienced everything this game has to offer in a measly six hours Alice not to say that shot beams at bats in fact honestly really like a lot of shots titles many games out there overstay their welcome sue a six hour game coming in eyes change of pace well and this is a big book 
shop games need to be priced accordingly as underwhelming this plan aims legend of Korra game lost it was at least priced appropriately twelve pounds I really respected doc and I gave was published by Activision fiat I think sexual assault what the legend of cost all that and more developers should take here that want a great game briefer campaigns 
shop in shouldn't be discouraged because developers otherwise might connect games are too long and all of the feeling as though they have too much filler so to today's game unless now give disco and then give the other eighteen eighty six a six out of ten 
All Things Considered it cardiac rage for the excellent presentation of the star attraction it's a poem enough experience while it lasts needless to say it they needed to be mom content pages the fire begins asking price that 
I don't know how 
I don't make something here 
extras well ok I didn't say that ok I'm so sorry but I can I can a missile looks yeah %HESITATION challenge mentions that many games lockable concepts online multiplayer behind this stuff okay but let's see what we've got here is a 
I don't know
