mt nnj mn I'll be the first to admit that when I heard they were making a new doom game I wasn't too impressed start as it didn't really need any kind of revival the original game still lives on strongly to the modding community more so I wasn't too happy that the festival also involved it's a game series I have a lot of love for and playing with my favorite franchises is like playing with my emotions 
but after finally having played the campaign in binged my way through the whole thing in two sittings I can finally say its software you did you glorious Boston's you actually did it dnmt 
course I'm referring to the single player campaign 
not the multi 
I'm not about ready to open the 
yes 
video is gay 
primary 
so I tuneful is everything I hoped it 
bane yes I know it's called do but I'm calling it doom for to avoid 
it's fast paced it 
challenging it's violent gorgeous and 
joyful from start to finish 
it's full of fanservice and it's made by people who clearly understand and love the rich 
is a few areas which reimagined 
I'm the old games and that even included more 
fighting 
it's hands down the best FPS I've played all year and one of the best FPS games to come along in a 
so the game opens with the character struck to some sort of demonic alter and breaking himself free from Chinese before being released on to you I say base which has gone to hell quite literally as a woman named livia pieces apparently orchestrated a demonic invasion 
yeah there's not really much to spoil in this game solve using footage from various points in the campaign and it probably should be a spoiler that you both go to hell and fight a saw the demon and spider mastermind I mean that's about as much a spoiler as it is saying you fight groom booze in Super Mario brothers 
anywhere you go out and buy your like doctor Samuel Hayden who context with various points throughout the campaign but there's not that much going on in the way plots there's about four five times absolute tops in the entire thing we have to stand still for more than like ten seconds and listen to expository dialogue immersive just moving to the levels completing objectives when you know killing things having said that though this is very much old school level design where you kind of dropped into these complex multi leveled areas allowing you to do things in the manner you choose Lotta combat areas of more like small deathmatch arranges for a bunch of demons for need and what the mole that before moving on there is a few lineaments but most the time you're able to do things that you write pace in like any old school game there's plenty of secrets hidden in alpha wife places 
as is pretty standard for modern game there's lots of challenges and operates to acquire as well you when weapon tokens by completing combat challenges such as killing a certain venues or killing them in a certain style these events spend on upgrading the primary and alternate formats for your weapons of which each weapon has to you also unspoken stop grade you suit giving your resistance to damage types in reducing the cool dance for your various combat abilities and then lastly there's Arjun energy again upgraded improved by stats for on my health and and the limits 
now these upgrades are essential amino purist could probably finish the tie game with at any of them but it does give the game some replay ability and also makes you feel like you're progressing your character's abilities the more you play the game 
it all flows right back into the combat which is really the heart and soul of doom for and holy shit this game is violent 
all of the weapons we know and love make a return we've got the shot John the super short guy on the chain gun plasma gun and of course the bay if she and chancel 
they've changed giants are a kind of wonderful items in a sense when you're given very little ammo for them but they wreck all kinds of shit when used 
the basic cable practically one short everything in university and the chancellor will also one showed an enemy using a certain amount of fuel depending on the enemy taught so you stand idiom it's going to require one charge but hell not will make you Chris will need three or make for 
all of the weapons have multiple alternate phimosis well so the plasma gun can build up excess heat and let it out in this damaging shockwaves machine gun has a repertoire missile system and the rocket launcher can log onto an enemy and fly free quick rockets in succession 
later in the Campanulaceae switch back and forth between these guns on the fly during some of the more chaotic combat sequences which are kana Megyn is going to be easier to control love but its sameness on the pay say and is also an upgrade that makes weapon switching foster as well 
I gotta say it's great seeing all these old enemy types again and saying how they've been brought into twenty sixteen hell knots and then a lot more agile leaping large distances and moving quite quickly compared to how slow that skull Korea did do three himself and leap around as well often holding onto ledges and throwing fireballs at you from a distance 
pinky Damon's are there are many can only be taken out from behind and lost souls now go into a sort of kamikaze mode which makes them even more annoying than ever before 
about the only enemy taught that hasn't been changed all that much is the bank Abbas who still just kind of lunges toward she firing away with his hand Kenneth 
but this is good old fashioned project all based combat at its absolute best and it's all about moving around being where you surroundings and minimizing the damage Tyke 
it is essential as doom for is a genuinely challenging game I chose to play the gamut ultraviolet's for my first playthrough and I'm kinda glad I did because I found it a good level of difficulty which was offset with the new weapons and upgrades Elvis gaining I will admit that there's a few cheap areas which don't have a good Florida repeat constricting but my city areas he fought in facilitate lots of movement which is essential as standing in one place is going to get you killed really quickly 
what's also cool is how each of the enemy thoughts has their own individual death animation now central mechanic of the game of the glory kills were able to finish off an enemy with a grisly execution 
this 
and this will differ greatly depending on the enemy top and also which forty five you're talking 
now could be the difference between ripping someone's arm off and beating them to death with that or pulling and neck around one hundred eighty degrees in almost snapping that goddam head off 
glory kills on as necessary or tedious as some people make them out to be a tough they only take one or two seconds in this plenty of health about the levels as these anyway 
well that I'm gonna silicon just blindly praising the game like it's some kind of masterpiece for starters most the game does look pretty damn good the performance of had hasn't been the best 
I'm running the game on the recommended settings in the frame rate still has a tendency to start in certain areas even with the latest drivers ominous not bringing everything to a grinding halt but it's definitely noticeable 
this sort of a side mode called room trawls which of these challenge modes on a very strict time limit and they things a literally just trial and error this only one path to complete them and it always comes down to the why I mean replaying these things Arbor Nova is a bit tedious 
socks nnj 
let's also address the elephant in the room yes the game uses checkpoints and yes they horrible there's nothing fun about fighting fifty Damon's fall asleep getting killed then having to fight them all over again also check points in a doom game seems like sacrilege 
more subjective thing is also the way that packaged up the physical copy of the game now after you've gotten the disc for the game they still make you download like an extra forty gigabytes on top of that for people like myself who have crappy internet that's corn of the whole reason we buy physical copies of games to not have to spend a day downloading the rest the only explanation I can come up with this that they did this to save money on having to distribute more David aids 
the only other show I hadn't again this is more subjective thing is that the game at times doesn't feel like it do in games that make sense this implant forming sections when you're pulling yourself I villages and making double jumps across bottomless pits which feel out of place I guess I rule at sait doesn't feel authentic but it's hard to put my finger on it 
and I really kind of wish they just made this as a blatant March to doom and cold at something else entirely because the game would still stand as it is regardless of the title slapping the doom name on it just seems like a lame way to get the game or notoriety I mean I guarantee you if it's off to have instead developed this as a throwback to old school FBS as opposed to a doom reboot it would have gone at the same attention 
I guess the real takeaway is that the game is just so much fun to play I mean after I finally got it all downloaded I'd be truly binged it for about five hours then the next day I came back in binged it for another three hours until it was alive it's that good 
therefore is like a plate of Reuben sandwiches but imagine you've got someone just standing there shop in the next one down your throat before you've even finish the previous bought any love ribbon salmon just so much that you just keep on trumpet and Dan 
it's everything you want in a game with the do Monica no weapon limit no health regeneration of sprinting barely any cinematics and no weaponry loading repente Sonny Jim rip and tear dnmt
