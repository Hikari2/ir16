hello world I'm Chris Carrillo in this week I'm here to share with you the seven things that I don't like about windows ten because last week I shared with you the seven things that I do like mn 
five mn instead of making a review based on the things that everybody else seems to talk about I want to talk about my experience because that's what it's all about when it comes to devices and before I begin let me go ahead and say that for the most part windows ten is a step in the right direction for the most part because it comes with caviar 
that does not mean that I am slacking on windows it just means that I see both the good and the bad I take them both and there I have 
the wife in the world don't move to the beat of just one drum what might be right for you may not be right for some a man is born 
first thing that I don't like is that you have to pay ten dollars for a year's worth of solitaire actually I'm kidding I I really don't mind that for complain about paying ten dollars for an ad free version of solitaire after they got windows ten for free come on do you have nothing else to complain about seriously if you got the windows ten upgrade for free and you had to pay ten dollars for a game that you like to play anyway what's the problem the true first thing that I don't really like is that the free windows ten upgrade only lasts for about a year so what that means is that if you have a system that's eligible for the 
do it with 
three hundred and 
actually fewer days than that now even mind that free upgrade path is tied to the PC not you I'm just saying while I appreciate it's a free upgrade that's a good thing it's that it's only lasting for a year and that's not such a good thing in my estimation if you're going to make it free now why don't make free forever how many times did Microsoft push back the end date for windows XP support is that also a possibility that Microsoft will say okay okay okay windows ten is free for another year I really don't know I just wish that if windows ten was going to be free that would be 
even if you 
maybe that would be a better monetization 
he for Mike 
you're playing minesweeper you clicked the wrong square in to your Microsoft another ten dollars that would make things interesting in please Microsoft do not take this idea seriously please next thing that I don't like about windows ten is that sometimes the transitions and animations are herky jerky and blinking and flashy 
that was my best impression of windows ten sometimes of course I'm exaggerating but since when do I not exaggerate I'm sure they're going to continue to smooth out the rough spots it's just that I still see here a few areas where a lot of rough spots need to be ironed out in speaking now the next thing that I don't like about windows ten is far too many legacy windows elements remain the way that Microsoft is involved the windows ten experience is rather magical but when you get smacked in the face with a dialogue for Mike nineteen ninety seven you just gotta get thrown backing though OneNote just me who sees a jarring difference between the windows of yester year end the windows of today and tomorrow for example 
I had some issues getting my microphone to work with Cortana 
triple wizard and all like 
no 
think the last time 
I saw this guy 
I was one 
it was a 
and I probably am as well undoubtedly the new windows ten you why is clean Intel you have to deal with legacy elements there updated in clean ish but also kind of an eyesore we just kind of stick out 
sure thing 
sore thumb 
similar components throughout on windows seven the same by 
put that 
something else that looks like a 
century 
well 
it's where you get 
kind of 
corky and even though I don't know for sure I believe 
Microsoft is probably going to be doing its best to clean up the craft 
still my 
spirits is based on what we 
today not what we might have tomorrow some people don't mind 
I do and I'm not talking about third party apps either I 
talking about the stuff that ships with windows 
you may be familiar with the ribbon interface in the file explorer on windows but on windows ten it looks like nnj 
you 
there if anything take this is me saying that the new feel of windows ten isn't nice 
everything else not so much and you gotta take the everything else when you get windows ten if you can deal with it or you don't see a problem with it for a year 
the next thing that I don't like about windows ten is that the privacy settings are somewhat confusing and opt out Microsoft has presented your privacy in such a way that it makes sense in context but also in such a way that a lot of users aren't going to bother to toggle the options I'm not here to say that the privacy policy is horrific that is for you to decide what I am saying is that it's somewhat difficult to navigate the options least comprehensive if you didn't know it by default when you download windows update you're also sharing your upload bandwidth with others get updates from Microsoft and get updates from and send updates to by default PCR my local network PC's army internet and that's just one of the settings that you might want to talk every other setting is buried within some other random by 
on her hands 
I don't know 
do my 
it's not very very 
simple 
solve the 
the thing I 
in but that 
probably be counter into 
fox business my 
to put it bluntly they want to be able to track 
you forever 
then again you could say the same 
company 
out there it's just that I don't think the 
going to know what's going on yes every user is given a choice but how many times do you 
you pass the defaults 
I'm pretty sure that statistic is what Microsoft is banking on but Hey it was a free upgrade and other companies are 
so why can't my 
that question is not for me to answer 
the next thing that I don't like is the windows store in general I love the idea of 
store unfortunately it's kind of lacking a lot of apps that I'd want to keep installed the windows stories getting there and I like the idea of 
once or downloading an app once and having it tied to my account to be able to access it from a number of windows machines but I'm just now waiting for other apps to be released so developers 
develop speaking of third party support next thing that I don't like is the lack of the party support where it counts 
specifically in the driver arena as much as I did run into too many snags in operating from windows eight point one to windows ten on the surface pro three PC which is mine I have some issues in trying to up grade to windows ten from other pieces in my house is that Microsoft's fault is that the %HESITATION yams above I don't know either way it's a problem for windows ten it's like the platform can't decide which utilities going to be responsible for upgrading everything your mileage may vary and I 
saying it's a drag 
something that I like the next thing I don't like about windows ten 
a fair amount of usability were done 
that is bad 
but it's still present in windows 
Craig 
field and as I selected that field to type 
keyboard and Paul 
the software keyboard and I did have 
keyboard attached and I was waiting for the ball up and then I had 
not that I was not into 
mode and couldn't use the screen but I can always touch the screen but needed to witness certain way to make sure that the keyboard pulls up dnmt was a step in the right direction but I feel that windows ten still doesn't know who it wants to be 
in winter on what creating a cohesive you ex is a challenge 
and I'm sure that Mike 
what is up 
or let me put it to you another way they have to be up for the task and they have to finish the task 
sooner rather than later and despite the things that I don't like about my windows ten experience I'm still under the belief that windows ten is a better experience than windows eight or windows seven I appreciate the time that you took to watch this review as well as the other one that I did last 
but the best review is going to 
from 
list yourself why 
somewhere in 
this is just my experience yours is probably 
completely different and that's okay 
in fact I would expect 
because there's only one me out there I'm not here to make up your mind for you that's your responsibility and if you want to see sixty exclusive
