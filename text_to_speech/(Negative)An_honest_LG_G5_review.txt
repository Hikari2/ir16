meet the LG G. five it's probably not making any bestseller list this year but not for the reasons you may think LG took a different approach this year and it's not your average flagship though its specifications may be rather bland but the idea behind the G5 is one where the of praise if anything 
if you're looking for a spec sheet it won't be this video but here's every reason I think that you should and shouldn't buy the LG five per stop you should definitely buy this thing for the camera I personally consider the second best next the galaxy a seven but it's a damn good sixteen megapixel shooter and there's also a super wide angle eight megapixel shooter on the backside as well which can easily be switched to from within the camera app voters are crispy colorful and all around great deputy has some tough competition in the camera spaces here but I thought LG camera will be good enough for just about anyone and a link some full resolution photos below if you want to check those out as well he should also pick up this phone for its beautiful five point three inch Q. HD display have always been a fan of LG in this department and they always shine in the G5 does not disappoint 
I don't have to say that overall the build quality is good though some people have seen issues but it feels solid to me none the less now long without the G5 definitely packs performance is great all around in this department and with the latest best vacations inside there's no doubt that it can hold its own against the competition but to be honest that's pretty much where the reasons that you should buy this end so here's the deal like most other LG releases the software is kind of a mess in my opinion it's just too much for me there's no app drawer which I know can easily be fixed with a custom launcher but the thing is LG software just feels lost overall and without any major direction and that's kind of how I've always felt about software now back to the build LG took a modular approach this year with the G. five and while I love the idea that someone had the guts to institute change in a flagship I just don't think that this idea will pan out for LG so here's the deal you can press a small button on the side to release the battery module which can easily be swapped out and that's pretty awesome for a phone with this kind of build but 
the thing is that this modular thing can only go so far currently LG has a handful of what they're calling friends but how long will they keep this up I mean it's a great idea but I just don't see it lasting too long it feels like more of a prototype if anything and I just don't think it's one LG's going to continuous and sadly I don't think that the G5 will be winning any design awards this year I mean sorry but not sorry this phone is kind of ugly though does feel well built but it's just not that appealing I don't know there's just something about it that's not super attractive and one final reason why I don't think that the LG five is something that you should pick up is if you're looking for battery life the G5 is not a great place to start I rarely got over four hours of screen on time here and I'm using the T. mobile variant so your mileage may vary with other carriers but I wasn't super impressed 
in this experience that's just me though the bottom line is that I'm a big fan of what LG has done with the G. five 
they've made a drastically different change over its predecessor which is awesome the modular thing is cool I applaud them for taking a chance but I really just don't think that everything here screams by me it's just I don't know that's just how I feel about the G. five but let me know you feel about the G5 in the comment section below and if you enjoyed this video feel free to leave a thumbs up as it does help out the channel a lot and subscribe for more videos like this in the future thanks again for watching everyone this is dom and I'll catch you in the next video
