bom bom bom bom dnmt push you know uncharted she was one of my favorite games of all time so I'm like crazy hyped for uncharted four and it's here and I got to play it I got a little early shout out to some random little store in queens that sold me the game a few days before came out you guys are awesome uncharted four is awesome I really like it it's completely 
different and a lot of ways like I I said this in our video game ranks but it's very much the same and familiar and not at all like it's very clear that Neil Druckmann 
because it feels distinctly different I almost want to say at times the tone field a little last of us like it's weird because it feels like the last of us but it doesn't because it's still very much like a swashbuckling Happel happy happy go lucky adventure with like you know sharp witted people and hunting for a treasure and swing on ropes and shooting guys and punching people and Elena loves Drake and there's like all this cool stuff so it's a so the game felt like a very interesting balance that is is very impressive it does feel like this time around the adventure is more important important entire than ever and 
it's all it all just works I like that this uncharted feels completely different than the other ones in 
always playing it feels very similar about just the game itself feels different because this time round the really double down on the characters the the emphasis on the characters developing these characters and making you feel for them is really important and it's good because they didn't 
just like how some games like it make to a new generation you here's your new version of this character now it takes the characters that have existed in this world already and just gives them more you know getting new versions of your favorite classic characters from the series you just get stronger versions of them and that's what I really appreciated especially and I'm not spoiling anything but an early scene between Nate and Elena and is just so great that the voice acting that the the facial animation everything about the scene and how simple and sweet it is is so nice and just sets up these characters and makes a believable and was such a great scene there's also an Easter egg early on in the game that made me lose my fucking mind for on a multitude of reasons number one the fact of the just the reference itself about number two X. seeing this reference in a game like uncharted for the state of the art thing it's just the contrast was amazing and it blew my mind and I was almost like 
cry I hope if you play the game you know I mean like the graphics are fucking incredible like everything about this game 
so great the level of detail on everything the realism is of everything that the emotion behind the characters faces the way they animate the way the game play is the way everything is so fluid them smoke affects the fire as Max 
the sun the lighting areas like a wet dream in terms of graphics I have a nice PC now and I can Max out shit but I I'd say every you know uncharted is different like I remember uncharted to being amazing looking and even compared to some PC games back then and I'll say it again now and I stand by uncharted four looks amazing even standing up to some PC games now I think it's two things with naughty dog it's number one just absolutely mastering and getting the absolute amount of power that you can out of a PlayStation four knowing every single little trick and detail and number two just really damn good art direction because this game definitely has that gameplay feels very the same you run you shoot you blind fire you duck and cover your job you climb a lot of shit a lot of stuff falls down and you have to jump and climb or are there just it's just presented in a different way now there's a lot of new scenes there's great scenes in the beginning there's a really awesome new fist fight with the fist fights in this game are just great because their stuff in the environment all you're really doing is mashing square but it's still just feels exciting and a little challenging and it's just great that it all works organically with the environment like natal throw someone against a wall or knock him into a bin and it all just works great and sort of shooting I think it's been a little rocky from the beginning of these games but now it's probably improved the most I can be especially with the added stealth aspect where you can sneak around and encounter before it starts a lot of times and guards have like a line of sight and like they can detect do everything it's really simple it's super rudimentary %HESITATION but it works it's fine it's effective it's very simple it's almost like how %HESITATION you know things were sped up and simplify the splinter cell conviction kind of feels like that like you just need to go in take guys out hope they don't see a and then if things if all how breaks lose you shoot everyone and it's fun to swing is cool swing on the rope is amazing because once you do that and punch a man in the face as you fall everything changes I do think the sound design here really does help the weapon itself because she 
if Iran does feel stronger I think mostly because of the sound and I think that's worth noting and also the driving sequences are really cool from the 
as to the more freeform exploration ones especially off roading it just feels cool if you're fun driving through mud trying to climb up hills 
it's just it actually is just fun consider not much going on just feels like a fun little off roading driving adventure and the action set pieces here are amazing I had to say like I think you may have seen a lot of them in ads or previews or E. three trailers and shit like that I but there still some surprises here and they're really great this uncharted game is going to take you places like you didn't really expect which is really cool Laku moments that I did not see coming as a crisis we 
this type of game but I like that about these games you always end up in different locations and they're always cool and they're always completely distinct from one another each scenario is different and cool and kind of memorable especially concerning some of the action sequences where you're like hanging from something or or pulling something or doing something they're really hard like sometimes it to kill guys while you're jumping from one thing to another it all gets really intense and challenging and I like a hard video game 
also it's getting the puzzles this time around require a lot of thought and I think it's actually pretty cool I'm surprised some of these puzzles are surprising at a stop and actually think for a second but I will say on the other hand are there's a lot of stuff we have to push a crate to get to a higher thing or you push a crate here to open up this part and just all the Cray pushing stuff is so fucking offensively bad I'm sorry everything about attorneys for is great except for this that is bad it feels like they ran out of ideas it's it's worse than the last of us within the pallets floating in the water but I digress has my one problem with the game people going to the gym thinking you're too hard on the game 
I don't have one complaint check this does feel like the longest uncharted I just got a lot of meat here I think part of it is yeah the game is long but also the cut scenes are 
surprisingly long but that's good it's enjoyable all shit is going on is fun to watch and you care about and I think open to close this is an enjoyable adventure this is a damn good uncharted game 
and a good and to Nathan Drake's story without spoiling there is this whole epilogue scene and it was surprising but also great and also kind of 
simple and expected by think what I like most about the ending is not just the actual ending itself but more what the characters learn because you know the emphasis on the characters here was so great that you know how they grew and like what they achieved any and really I thought that was really cool and I love the graphics the story the game play the character the moments the scenes is my favorite uncharted game personally I think I still love to the most but this is a damn good game and I definitely can recommend it just and I don't know this is just about uncharted games like it it just puts a smile on my face the entire time
