everyone this is Steve from gamers nexus Donna and today we're talking I watch dogs this is the official review I've already spoken about the PC performance on multiple video cards these talks about mouse movin if talks about crash fixes we've talked to a PC authorization and all these things happen because watchdogs inshore has been somewhat of a disaster in terms of its release on the PC as a platform so that gives you a bit of a spoiler as to what I think in this review %HESITATION the review will contain discussion on hardware optimization it will go into bugs I've experienced 
%HESITATION me doing Ubisoft's cue a job for them talk you know fundamental design issues unintuitive input do mean the games the user abandonment and send the conclusion so quite a bit of stuff stuff to go over here today and it's all stemming from one single factor and that is that this game has been hyped to oblivion and back and it is and it's completely unable to achieve any of the expectations set by that hive so that is a fault of the industry and of the consumers but it's not a not necessarily something will dive into too deeply here in this review so that's a lot of topics let's start with the hardware since that is the easiest to discuss putting at short watchdogs is the most horribly optimized PC game I have ever had the misfortune of playing in recent years type info is pretty damn bad watchdogs isn't highly new levels of that it was %HESITATION I I achieved 
all of fifty three FPS on average when using a seven EDT I in combination with the forty seven seventy K. and lots and lots of ram that was at a very high speed 
and 
the performance is detrimental for several reasons first of all you be soft has failed optimized their game for computer hardware in general I'm sure rob her friends her more 
acceptably on consoles but on PC it is totally unacceptable to have fifty three FPS with almost Max settings on a seven eighty TI which is a seven hundred twenty dollar video card that has two thousand eight hundred eighty cores it's got five teraflops of rock and few power at three gigabyte framebuffer I mean the thing 
has a memory bandwidth of three hundred thirty six gigabytes per second so we know we're capable of filling that framebuffer if necessary and yet the game performs horribly on it so why is that well after some research it looks like a lot of it is %HESITATION it's really it's two fold one 
part is anti aliasing for some reason antialiasing is a massive hit the performance and watch dogs more so than I've seen in every at any other game I've ever benchmark 
and that's an issue until the South Park feelings optimize it and I'm probably build anti aliasing properly 
into the game %HESITATION and this is evidenced by the fact that jumping between I must say for
