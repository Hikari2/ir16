mt nndb nndb these to be taken in by destiny's gorgeous shell a slick and striking wrapper that surrounds the hollow and unimaginative game languishing inside of it make no mistake destiny's mechanical basics are for the most part superb interacting with this multi player only shooter is in the light gutsy shooting the fluid movement the intuitive menus the smooth frame rate all of these elements make for a fantastic foundation for building a great dynamic multi player shooter upon the disappointment of destiny is how it puts that solid foundation to use the game is built upon soloist repetition of on imaginative ideas take for instance the story missions and strike missions which have you taking to destiny's broad and beautiful settings with a friend or two at your side by and large every mission task is built upon the same idea wait for your robotic companion which is voiced by game of thrones actor Peter Dinklage to hack into something usually adore then you shoot a bunch of cool looking aliens and possibly a predictable bullet sponge boss that absorbs five minutes worth of gunfire before it falls fan Dingell Bartels you he's finished coincidentally right after you finish killing the last enemy and you ensure the next beautiful area to do it all again different doors possibly different enemies but no meaning

but once again those excellent basics are betrayed by slow paced and redundant tasks that have you asking yourself Hey isn't this the same canyon I was heading down five minutes ago Hey didn't I just cross this hill ten minutes ago and twenty minutes ago and done now or ago it's tempting to compare destiny

doing so reveals how much more diverse typical MMOGs really are by contrast destiny gives it

certainly tries to tell a story a story that seems like it might come into its own about halfway through when you meet two of destiny's few non Ding 
characters alas destiny wastes the opportunity to develop a mystery worth caring about and reverts to more fetch quests followed by a manipulative ending that reminds you that the game's soundtrack does far more work in establishing this world's tone than the mediocre writing ever does 
Dinklage is sleepy not quite robot not quite human delivery doesn't help in the 
regard 
to be fair some of the item description 
and the lord heavy stories you can

fill in some narrative gaps 
you'd be hard pressed to remember much that happened 
destiny story let alone under 
and them once you leave behind which 
I take you around fifteen hours 
there's loot of course much of it in the form of new weapons or weapon blueprints called engrams 
you can redeem at a hub called the tower which you share with a dozen plus other players if you're used to the pleasure of loot you receive while playing games like borderlands or Diablo three however make sure to prepare for destiny's slower pace for doling out rewards it's perhaps befitting that meaningful new stuff doesn't come that frequently given how destiny on the whole feels like a standard sized experience stretched entirely too thin other aspects of destiny feel less stretched into oblivion than they do holy under done the presence of other players not your group for example is more window dressing than vital mechanic 
given how few appear in your travels and how very rare public combat events are that bring people together once you reach level twenty you might enjoy the upcoming rate event though it's not yet available as of the time of this review it's not yet certain however that repeating a raid will be any more fun than repeating strikes and story missions which along with competitive multi player are the only things you truly do once you finished 
story if you enjoy grinding for here that's a good thing the promise of wearing better stuff is the sole purpose to forging ahead the crucible where destiny's competitive multiplayer lurks is quite competent developer bungee shows off its mastery of level design with maps of various sizes that get used across four different modes six member deathmatch finds its legs on maps that recall the winding corridors and central combat arenas of unreal tournament and team deathmatch functions just fine control mode is the most enjoyable however allowing both lone wolves and focused 
tribute sometimes 
cockpit of one of the two ground vehicles available there are some issues here 
the way the auto targeting can cause one opponent to grab your targeting reticle when you're trying to fire at a different target 
however competitive play proves itself a worthy way of leveling up and earning access to items you were

cells in the basics but is lacking in creative 
heart it is a clearly expensive game lavishly produced and devoted to showing off its amazing but sterile environments 
that look like this world had far better stories to tell in the past long before you ever set foot in it the fantastic gunplay and promise of better loot couldn't 
forward the sheer lack of mission diversity and overall creativity however make it equally as likely you'll be destiny behind for something with more excitement and more soul dnmt
