in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast 
it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the caucuses at intervals go round and round at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity 
with which they revolved upon the cards 
it is a site that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwanted emotion
