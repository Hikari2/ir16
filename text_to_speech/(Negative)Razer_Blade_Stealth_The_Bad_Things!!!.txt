Hey you what's up their fellow citizens of the internet my name is Moses and you watching the sun red blue today I will be skating on the razor blade step sister raises Delfan nndb nndb nndb 
now some of these things are things that you and I are going to agree 
and that we hope that our razor actually 
you just and sound is just more of a personal loan EBD 
gonna preferences if you would 
okay so if the first one is undeniably the best 
right we we we gotta get rid of the battles I mean 
it is day in aids these big of bezels on me 
laptop or icon on the left are so small 
it's practically unacceptable I mean the laptop itself is good decides is great but the bezels just are just hear me well 
I mean would you ask razor you need to make some Basil is or at least it leaves cut down bezels man businesses are too thick unacceptable 
amber 
and %HESITATION 
they're simply not good man I mean just you don't want some 
be 
that 
bevels on for size meant all corners of though I think that means that 
they would rather have the ultrabook itself through small and then now you gotta have let you know in each one on all four sides of worth of bills useless space basically 
we don't need that the second thing that I don't really like about the razor blade staff I mean I do like about it but and 
it's 
the keyboard right BR RGB keyboard now that may sound like crazy %HESITATION because I was one of the selling points of razors the RGB keyboard 
but to be honest the keyboard gets old really really really really fast I mean 
you won't be playing with hers 
lights 
for long at all I've owned the laptop for about one month now amount of money never so so I am going to be talking about is not something that I that's bad about it just them that I 
you should know before you actually buy laptop if you look at all the the keeper collars of you and you get all excited she should know it is going to get old really really really fast 
right %HESITATION now the third point that I nuns really hate about it but it's gonna dnmt 
that is okay is the performance right so I didn't buy the laptop knowing that is not going to be like a gaming powerhouse right but I expected that sense you know the reserve corps will be coming out that I'll be getting some decent performance out of it right but there is a gorgeous get released and it is I mean just announced 
and the price and everything 
five hundred books 
just by being closer I mean that is not 
right so right now I'm kind of pissed because they you either going to spend another thousand Bucks GOP by the inclusion of and by the graphics card 
%HESITATION 
for what so totally you're going to spend two grand 
to buy the reserves still 
and there is a core 
even if you just by that they knew each other things 
and razor blade 
rand as well 
so why the heck bother 
you know so that pissed me off that now it's in the performance of it kinda sucks so I went ahead and you know played a few games on N. diseases 
it sucks man I mean it's easy I always are seeing right now is I am playing at the lowest settings that I could possibly can figure this game and this is the hour 
black ops are black ops three 
and it sucks you know it really really really sucks eyes very slow is just not not good enough 
so 
it's first of all as far as performance goes I mean I knew what I was getting into when you was going to be a little slow but still it's kind of like all my goodness this is a lot slower than I thought and I can only give the reasons are there is a core because it'd been records too expensive for no reason just right so chance for a any closer right so that's why I kind of got pissed me off the fourth one that I that I can't take about 
is out of the speakers now I know it is a smaller device so you know it's not going to be you know that allowed you can have the small device but with a decent sound to it 
viz speakers are not are not good speakers that are I mean take a look I mean take a listen and %HESITATION it's not it doesn't sound the right here is going to listen to the song dnmt 
%HESITATION 
mtn 
jn 
cool 
right so it's easier if you can tell it's it's it's not good to the eerie doesn't sound like it's reached not a rich sound in a sense 
%HESITATION that way they could have made it better %HESITATION that that's but as just one of this 
small things I 
I think that %HESITATION you should know before you actually purchase the other is a stealth 
so and then we go to the fifth one which is the camera 
and them built in microphones right alright so I don't know how to rate the camera on this thing or the microphones %HESITATION so I will kind of leave that to you based on what you see so if you if you think that this is a very clear image and that the sound is projected quite well and the microphones are able to obtain the sound the way that you would think that is quite reasonable 
then I guess that would be good for you but I am I would not say that he has the best microphone 
I'm the market out there but I would say that the camera is 
quite good 
quite good but not necessarily 
but you but the judge 
so if you could see from the footage microphones could be a lot better could be improved could be better our microphones 
I mean I hate on I'm just saying you know it's not 
the best sound that I've ever heard on the laptop I had to find a fifteen to heat up right I mean if we give you go for things to hate are you might as well throw in a fifth one %HESITATION but no it's one of the cameras and microphones are concerned 
it's a personal thing is a personal preference it is that it is an awesome book is a laptop and as you say you're not going to have you with the best camera or the best microphone on it but I believe he should be somewhat distant alright so just a real quick recap of what I was saying 
the first thing that I hate is the bezels and I believe you and I can really agree on agree on that and the second thing we hear is that the keyboard although it is a great keyboard and seven point was the RPG feature on it it gets old really quick the third one is a performance 
performance not because I expected to perform really well but 
given that I was waiting for the reserve corps %HESITATION assuming that it really records and be around two hundred three hundred Bucks end up being five hundred Bucks and now you gonna be stuck with that 
%HESITATION the performance of it was going to 
so actually if you if you are the content creator or if you I mean it's going to do at some editing some even some video games 
you know you know %HESITATION you gonna be stranded right you will be able to play them are going to games 
the fourth one being that you know the speakers although the device is quite small the speakers could actually be better for as a device that small I mean I form speakers are somewhat better than that 
right in band the fifth one being the camera in the mail in the built in microphone which is just a personal preference I believe that it microphone could be better by the camera not so much now these are the five things that I believe the you should know before going out there and putting his device because once you purchase it %HESITATION later run down the road you will realize all my goodness I selling point of it is not I'm not really getting as much as I thought I would be getting out of it 
so I missed a figment pristine the reserve corps and in excellent graphics card basically another thousand dollars %HESITATION 
probably going get of the razor blade stuff right now 
but otherwise 
go for it my name is Moses you watching the sun red blue 
and I'll see you in the next
