mk nnj after years of remorse analyzing conspiracy theories and hoping for legs venture into the wasteland fans of pas apocalyptic RPG's finally got their hands own filed for because this newest sandbox was probably the most hyped title twenty fifteen and to sales reflect that accordingly 
however the title seems to be polarizing his audience 
some claim the new S. followed is a great title while others feel greatly disappointed by its simplicity and numerous flaws 
that's because the snow was triple a game qualify as title worthy of the legendary series 
just looking for love sweetheart girl 
have you come to the wrong place my Lovin days have long since passed 
first things first what is RPG without the great story 
well it's something not found for similarly to follow three we're treated to a fish out of water story motivated by search for missing relative 
as in the previous fallout some quests are is our own exceptional tales and many a time provides bizarre or entertaining stories 
the plot however leaves much to be desired 
filled with fetch quests and other repetitive activities 
every once in awhile you'll be amazed only to build boards again with a task accompanied with a been there done that kind of feeling 
the question is for despoiled by simplistic dialogues and a lack of the karma system or any reaction whatsoever of the world's two or more questionable acts 
like mass effects commander Shepard we are the good guy 
even if we try our best at being a sarcastic sociopath 
it's weird that final takes a step back compared to twenty eleven's new Vegas where that element was one of the game's strongest points 
in other words after the engaging and intriguing dialects of which are three fought for feels like an unfinished product for a casual gamer character progression is also certain to raise some eyebrows 
special system isn't so special anymore 
most of the parks don't really affect the game play and despite our choices becomes very forgiving 
it doesn't matter whether we like computers are lock picks 
we'll enter just children anyway 
worst of all no matter if you are a hacker or a sweet talker your plate was will be much alike nevertheless shooting is more fun than ever was in the Pacific elliptic franchise and the vat system works like a dream to majority of the game the recent found out plays like borderlands but it doesn't matter scavenging the wasteland and shooting their way through bandit outpost is a lot of fun 
if you weren't born yesterday you've probably heard that Bethesda's games are known for beautifully parrot and into the world's neither unfortunately scarred by glitches 
this statement is not far from the truth once again as the Commonwealth AKP Boston despite being littered with horrible glitches is a magnificent place to explore you can point to a random direction grab a shotgun and accompanied by a dog or one of a dozen available companions embarked on a quest to write your own Mad Max kind of story 
the beautiful and deadly world of fallout four is a shining example exploration done right has despise against many pickups 
because the plank only to see was around the corner and what lute maybe find the next location apart from that the game was a greater focus on crafting than ever before being able to build our own base and with our equipment 
that's a lot of playtime and allows for player crickets Vitti in ways no fault has before holding junk in the game world finally has some sense to it as various objects will help us in building crazy weapons or more sturdy furniture so team twice before you so that the concrete and those light bulbs 
despite this element being just OK wouldn't think twice about exchanging it for a better story where more complex dialogues even now we are under the impression that because the has focused more on that than on other elements typical to follow out 
as if to appeal to younger audience that is a gift to minecraft 
last but not least comes folk look and sound 
the sound specifically something to Marvel at lemon city radio helps them nude sank in what's is prewar classics while the original score emphasizing the destruction and misery of the nuclear Holocaust since shivers down her spine and fills a gamer with a sense of hope and wonder 
the sounds taking from the main theme that place after completing a quest makes even the dollars to fetch quests in epic and fills us with a sense of accomplishment in a way 
otherwise looks great and the landscapes make us turn to the distance of once in a while the overall quality of the graphics is disappointing 
aside from quitting textures poor physics weak facial animation frame rates drops and other issues the graphics quality is overall two steps behind motor standards 
it's sad that such an amazing art style of the world and some great location designs are weekends by graphics of lower standards 
lucky for the PC audience fallout four is yet to shine was mothers get their hands on it 
so 
what do you say 
I don't know it's a big decision 
so I understand her hesitation 
in conclusion followed for most of the time feels like fallout three point five 
it isn't a bad game two perfectly honest 
it's a funny it's flawed casual sandbox with RPG elements that wants to be taken seriously as an RPG 
if it was an entirely different IP you take back some of the criticism and focus on the addictive exploration and fun shooting 
but the final game 
and the battle at that 
it's sad to see Bethesda take several steps back 
ignore decease RPG Ritz and kill its depth 
considering the fact that previous bouts had better dialogues character development and more consequences for actions 
we hope that filed for is only a transition point in the series history and Bethesda will get back in shape soon as it stands now product for is a bit disappointing for this response but can still be found to newcomers and those less hearts RPG fanatics 
overall followed for isn't fun yeah it's mediocre game 
certainly better than photo three but as an RPG it's outclassed by fallout two and new Vegas nearly every possible way so keep that in mind plans to pick it up 
thanks for watching and stay tuned to give pressure 
mt 
let's go 
five
