welcome to Linus tech tips make sure you guys subscribe for our I think awesome maybe you think it's awesome too daily technically does they were gonna be checking out the Ducky shine many a sixty percent size keyboard with a whole lot more under the hood than initially meets the eye 
sn nd 
cooler master Neptune series CPU coolers are available in a variety of radiator sizes to perfectly suit your next build click now to learn more 
despite the as expected excellent build quality with you know it's a aluminum housing and stuff right off the bat there was some stuff I really didn't like about the shine mini somethings are good you can use the function modifier to access your after he's volume control arrow keys print screen etcetera but it's tiny layout means that it has to make the best 
possible use on the key is that it has and I really felt like not having a function key on the left hand side requiring a function modifier to access escape and having tilde is the main layer over there and the placement of the arrow keys in the second layer on the right directly above the loan function keys you can barely get both hands in there were pretty serious sins 
then I I put on my actually doing reviews instead of just hating on things based on initial impressions hat and checked out the stuff that came in the box turns out you get a plastic dust cover you get a key cap remover you get a warranty card you get some replacement laser etched keycaps and %HESITATION yes the manual turns out Ducky thought of everything that I just pitched about you can use those replacement key caps and some really neat reconfigure ability of the keyboard to change the escape key functionality and a contextual menu button swap the priority I'll delete and backspace and another function key where ever you want on the bottom row as long as you don't override both of your controls both of your also tetra and change the way that the internet lock key to something a little more useful like function or control friggin awesome we're off to a good start here now the setup process for this is as into it as I think that he would like to think it is indefinitely core acquire some trial and error the manual or the kind of 
intimacy with the functionality of a keyboard that only certain people ever have but if you've got a reference in front of you it's pretty quick to set up and even that is not the kind of thing that you need to do often anyway just hold function alt each to enter the docking adviser setup mode and the appropriate keys will be eliminated to quit slowed and if you press anything else it will guide you through the reconfiguration us using illuminated numeric keys to change modes awesome again and I haven't even touched on lighting at a Kentucky shine so of course there are lights and this time it's not just single colored lights we get dual LEDs in each case which they can operate alone or blended together for a pretty satisfying variety of colors 
you can change modes where function alt Gee from a hundred percent backlit with any blended color you'd like just unjust each LED by holding Z. or acts 
to reactive typing with the same independent LED brightness controls to reactive mode with randomized colors actually really like this one too tripping balls known also known as completely random attacks on every key all the time to wave mode which is pretty self explanatory to color cycling on which to cycle through every available color to finally off mode which if you're using on a Ducky shine 
is is basically bad and you should feel bad 
one last leading notice the custom mode which allows you to use the LED in the caps lock key to determine what color your side and then assign individual colors per chi you can save to user defined schemes here that you can recall using functional me or be which leaves us what the final feature one that I intentionally glossed over at the beginning of this video and expected to give exactly zero cares about because when Nick told me about it I was like 
who could actually end up being one of my favorite features on this keyboard burnouts and elation keep lock 
hold function and use WASD to move the mouse cursor around you can also with nearby keys press left or right click and you can actually swap was around duck adviser if you prefer you can even read the scroll wheel up and down the only unfortunate thing that's missing is that you can't middle click the scroll wheel but the acceleration curves are well tuned and overall it works surprisingly well this whole review was done on my laptop without touching the trackpad or a mouse and without getting frustrated I used my keyboard almost noon 
now we just need a wireless phone for immediate PC users 
so conclusion time then it's a Ducky so that means you get all the things that go along with that their stellar reputation for build quality genuine cherry IMAX key switches no software required for configuration of any of its functionality which means 
everything it does works on any OS anytime but that you can't really fine tune things like if I wanted a trip balls mode to leave off out of the randomized pattern for example 
but 
all that docking goodness comes with one big caviar here you need to decide if a sixty percent is right for you you get the extra desk space especially on the right side where you move your mouse with the ergonomic benefits that are associated with having your arms closer together but you lose convenient access to a lot of keys on your keyboard that you might find yourself missing at least for awhile while you're still getting used to it 
speaking of getting used to things feels aren't hard to get used to and thought how do you have we got one for you today today's vanilla sponsored by mass drop and they worked with Ducky to bring you guys an awesome deal that is live right now unlucky shiny in this video you can get it with cherry amex red or blue switches or for a limited time with the very unusual cherry annex clear switches
