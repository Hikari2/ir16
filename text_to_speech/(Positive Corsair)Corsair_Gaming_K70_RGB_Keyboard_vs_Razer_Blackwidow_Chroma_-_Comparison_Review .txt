I almost always competition is a great thing for the consumer went to products into companies go head to head in a fight to make the best product the consumer always wins and today that's going to be doing for you guys are going to be doing a review and comparison of two products in two different companies 
corsair increasing 
and if you have a guest already what this is going to be it's going to be a comparison video against the corsair gaming K. seventy RGB mechanical keyboard 
razor blade 
with no 
chroma key 
or is that take advantage of the 
craze 
RGB LED light 
referrals so we're going to do is get all that comparison pros cons all the stuff you should know that both these keyboards and in the end of my journal input and the pin 
on them in which one I think 
you should buy mn 
and nbsp 
nnj 
and nbsp 
the first thing is appearance in both identical their predecessor 
and the box they do nothing for you plug them in down under specific software 
%HESITATION foregoing questions this I received the coarser keyboard before they were branded and switch the keyboards Logan of the current one 
and by the way I've done both on boxing's interviews for both keyboard so hit subscribe when you're done watching this you go check them out 
because our gaming case seventy is made of anodized aluminum with a nice brushed metal finish 
giving it a professional look 
the reason chrome on the other hand is all plastic unfortunately 
fingerprints or elsewhere hand can easily be seen whenever you touch the keyboard 
both he was have a nice thick braided USB cord and both attend little feet on the keyboard to elevate its backside making air ground the easier to type 
other than that the feature pretty much the basics you to spectrum any other normal keyboard but each kind of edge of a rat when it comes it is the Vic functions and keys 
the corsair features designate Iniki's as well as a buyer some polling feature on the backside while the reserve chroma has five macro keys on its left side and the U. S. B. slot as well as a microphone had from Jack we found on the rates at a keyboard 
they had to give the edge to one of these I think at the course there really because it just looks like a higher quality premium keyboard verses readers cheap plastic 
produce little sound test for you guys and says maybe something that some people 
individual course their keyboard has an extra rats which is inside although bloom brown can be purchased as well 
this is where it gets heated 
both companies have designated software to power the RGB LED lights inside that bring the keyboard a life for course there there's a significant learning curve and it's actually pretty intimidating ill take a long time to mess with but only our segment of learning is by messing with and getting hands on experience 
whoever wants to do the possibilities are pretty much and listen you can she almost any effect any color to any key and compilation you can think of 
you can group all these effects and colors make the keyboard one giant unique light show 
if you can't make yourself the no worries because the course our forms page has a ton of other posts of people who create their own profiles they posted for the committee to download and you can just import that file to your own specific software and out on your keyboards at the ceiling you like you can just download it now is yours 
on the other hand raiser synapse to put a software is very simple like it should be itself was phantom of preset effects and features making only effort worth arguing to put into it just what colors you Mar what features you want to do 
you can easily achieve the rainbow effect with the wave feature to lead cannot do in the course are key were having to press a key to act with the rainbow effect 
having gained presets awesome because a highlight certain keys and which games you use most often they have certain genres like FPS animal in certain games like counter strike %HESITATION Doda legal legends were it highlights the main keys are going to use on the keyboard 
from there they also have a custom feature you can just make any key any color you want on the keyboard and my favorite effect is called reactive and that's pretty much it makes it makes a key paltry sum you press that you treated duration of how long this is late for I like a lot so awesome stuff reserve and thanks for making it simple 
in the end it's honestly really hard for me to pick a winner winner here 
when I first had the course a gaming K. seventy keyboard little over a month ago I instantly fell in love with it it was my first full in mechanical keyboard and I love the fact that the software could enable sixteen point eight million colors on the keyboard you know first blew me away I love the I love how the possibilities are virtually endless all the stuff you can make it through the effects were awesome 
having said that and having used razor chroma for the past two weeks 
well I decided to break out the corsair gaming keyboard again and put them head to head just for my own purposes I was blown away and that's why I'm making this review a comparison 
the lights 
is the biggest difference here 
the lighting in the course are gaming keyboard is kind of different the way they have it's constructed by those little plastic shell as opposed to make daily life inside illuminate the key itself 
in theory yes it works but now comparing it to the reserve chroma key board it is literally like night and day 
corsairs lights are very very dull in comparison now to the neon inviolate delights 
inside the reserve chroma and I think it's largely in part due to the fact of how the chrome is constructed with that white board underneath the keys and the other housing on the keyboard itself that really makes the lights pop 
on corsair I love how the keyboards constructed to very nice and solid feel the optional wrist rest is awesome and the media keys the big bonus however when you look at razor and what they've worked with this keyboard 
I I kinda have to give the edge to raise our here they have the five macro keys you can program it changed whatever you want with different profiles 
they have their very bright lights 
on the side which is something that I really wanted in the corsair K. seventy 
they have a designated U. S. be an actress USB slots you can plug your mouse 
your thumb drive anything to save space as well as a headphone Jack and a microphone Jack 
to me that is huge and that's what sets it apart now that I've kind of picked on course there for a bit now its reserves turn 
so I think on the keyboard kind of confused me 
like one why aren't all the character keys illuminated let the easily could be like on the number pad 
second by some of the function options very dimly shining through the keyboard itself and not in its own designated area 
seems kind of pointless to me I would have loved to seen that an intermediate keys there instead actually serving a purpose 
and third I'm just not a big fan of their specific 
professional gaming switches that are inside 
it does not feel like an amex cherry red switch doesn't feel like a truly mechanical keyboard Simi 
and it's very loud and clicking kind of obnoxious after awhile legacies having used a true advocate will keep or with the and I share Reds inside the tradition is different 
and it just kind of felt cheap to me 
but I that's just my personal opinion so in the end guys a comes down to what do you want from your keyboard is the reason you're buying this just for the LEDs just so you can have this vibrant flashy LED lights when you're staring at your computer screen I'd really paying attention to the keyboard itself 
if so then I have to give hands down razor the award here because I've never seen LED light shine so bright any keyboard or any given peripheral for that matter those LED lights of they've put into it with that whitewater needs they it just makes the entire keyboard pop and flash and it is so much brighter than the corsair gaming keyboard that is honestly it's not even a competition 
that's what you want and razor is going to be your best option cover with LED lights that's kind of a double edged sword because maybe people don't want very flashy bright lights distracted them while they're playing 
after all you're not staring at your keyboard while you're playing you're staring at the screen maybe dimmer lights are good for some people so that's not distracting them you know for corsair if you want the option of lily do anything you want with the robust software can corsairs the way to go it's a nice respected company the keyboard is made of high quality material it's 
struck did very nicely and it's going to do what you want to do I know people who give them much crap lately because they hate the new logo on the keyboard the corsair tramp stamp 
but also that's going not going to be I don't think enough 
sway someone's opinion almost keyboard to get 
in the end if I had to pick a clear winner four hundred seventy dollars I think I'd go with the course are giving case seventy keyboard 
now yes the lights on the reserve from are much brighter and more vibrant 
but in the end it doesn't justify the price for me especially since 
keyboard is made entirely of plastic and comparing at the corsairs brushed metal an anodized aluminum finish 
it doesn't makes corsair look very professional and premium and that's what you're paying the money for it 
still has a better software in the end you know it's confusing I just think hands down we had to pick one winner I would go with the repeat purchase of the corsair gaming K. seventy keyboard 
I just want to put these two keyboards head to head a test for you guys because they're too the best keyboards out right now you can get with this whole craze of the RGB LED lights inside so I put it had had for you 
so hopefully this will help you
