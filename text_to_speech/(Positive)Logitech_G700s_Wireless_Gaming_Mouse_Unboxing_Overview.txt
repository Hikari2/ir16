welcome to my unboxing and first look at the G. seven hundred ass from Logitech the key difference between their seven series my so the G7 the G. seven hundred and now the G. seven hundred S. 
is the fact that they are all wireless but gaming grade 
the G7 was really the first mouse that was marketed as a gaming grade wireless mouse 
and the difference between game incapable wireless mice and noggin incapable ones is all about the latency so creating a wireless connection that is low latency enough that gamers are going to notice any input lag from the mouth is key to being able to well being able to be responsive enough particularly for FPS gamers in order to really with a straight face call it gaming grade now Logitech has recently operated upon you while pretty much their entire G. series of products 
with this S. 
suffix at the end of it so that asks is for I don't know for 
bream performance art surfacing something like that and what they've really done is they've updated the materials that they're using on the products themselves covering them in a hydrophobic coding upgrading things like the grip the sides upgrading everything about them to make them last longer and feel better on the user's hand so they shouldn't get all sort of greasy and sweaty and nasty and they should be easier to grip and they shouldn't peel back in fact my only complaint about one of my favorite my severed the gene nine was the fact that my great appeal other than that it was near perfect let's see what else Logitech has to say for themselves about this 
two hundred all the way up to eighty two hundred DP I giving you the ultimate in flexibility so that's twelve megapixels per second and image processing and them had a maximum speed of up to four meters per second so for contacts that's tested on popular gaming mouse pad services suffer context guys might be like 
if I was moving my does this fast 
Mike probably faster like no one actually well okay maybe someone actually moves like that over a very short distance but either way I should be able to handle it 
our cousins go pack up back to the box over here I sixteen that's praxis up to a thousand reports per second great for a wireless mouse is only a few that are capable of that and durability of twenty million clicks for the buttons and two hundred and fifty kilometers for the field unfortunately they don't say what surface that is on so apparently the buttons are fingerprint resistant answer you can recharge and handle data over a single connection that has five onboard memory profiles which you can switch between with this button thirteen programmable buttons and you can adjust your DP I on the fly no one of the coolest Logitech features that they really introduced significantly what's in here 
%HESITATION but I'll talk about the scroll wheel in a minute he's got an extension cord for the wireless receiver and it does not use the same unified wireless receiver that their other products are capable of connecting to this is a special one and you it is just for your gaming mouse because the data rates required are higher than on their consumer grade products 
they go this extension cable is about %HESITATION I don't but nothing less than a Linus arm spends it must be around five feet long and then you can run that December you're going to have good reception there are flat bottom pieces here see sticker certainly do whatever you want with it we've also got a cable that could be used to charge the mouth or run in wired mode 
so this one right here is not rated or anything like that in fact out of all the mice I'd seen so far from their new GE as series the G. five hundred us is the only one that had a braided cable it doesn't really affect performance but it's one of those premium feeling things that I wouldn't mind seeing if they could included so you can see how plugs and right here so you can plug it into charge unplug it to not charge and it'll look just like a Wierd mouse when you are not operating it in that fashion 
that's a look at what else they got included here looks like a setup guide club thing into the thing in all likelihood warranty information it does have a three year warranty it should be noted that Logitech's warranty is absolutely legendary I've personally experienced in the past many times they don't even require you to ship the product back to them at all 
to hear the battery on love to see that if you guys been watching my videos for any kind of period of time you'll know I love Sanyo eneloop so I guess now they're pendant Panasonic whatever listens to us SNU branding on it I love eneloops there the bastard rechargeable batteries that awesome and the cool thing about eneloops is it means your G. seven hundred us is going to arrive ready to play you know I have to charge it before you use it because they hold a charge incredibly well 
others an on off switch at the bottom so you can turn it off when you're in transit and they have enormous non slip are enormous %HESITATION slippy pads on the bottom of the mouse this doesn't affect how much friction the mouse has with the surface below it because that's not how fiction works but what it does do is effectively makes the most more durable because there's no hair there there's more surface to rub off overtime so that's I guess how they're getting that two hundred and fifty kilometer durability on the mass itself so let's go ahead and violence 
get this and get this milestone so we've got a right handed shape which we've come to expect from Logitech gaming mice they don't have a left handed mouse I kind of wish they do and I know that many Latin 
do you buy it it's a very ergonomic shape now you can see here this is designed for palm the shape here fits right into your palm and you can quite comfortably especially if you have slightly larger hands in the I have quite small hands so you can see there's a fair bit of space left at the end of the buttons and my index finger six in such a way that I'm kind of between these two so if you have medium sized hands you'd sit right here where you can very easily press this one this one or this one seventh of the G8 G. nine and 
but the 
fully programmable buttons 
%HESITATION 
then your hand would also set a little bit more forward on the mouse and you know be a little bit more comfortable so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for people if super small hands like I have on the side almost you've got four more G. buttons as well as the battery indicator and a very very nice coating finish here we've seen this already on some of the other GS series nice and its equally impressive here however I haven't used them for long enough to get my hand slightly to the point where I've observed the difference in the hydrophobic coding now back to the scroll wheel this is such an awesome Logitech feature I ask I love it so normally the cookies for awhile here I'm gonna hold it up to the Mike appeared because guys can hear 
but that click here that alright awesome now check this out by pressing this gear button this disengage button here 
free spin so if you don't use your mouse only for gaming in you also use it for work maybe want to find something to like about Gillian scroll wheel flex you can just click the mouse you can browse through excel sheets web pages whatever else very very quickly just a flick stop when you see the thing you want to see and it's absolutely awesome I believe this but not yet this button right here cycling through the DP I profiles so we got one two three four five different DPR profiles just by clicking on that but not at the top but you can really find the G. buttons to whatever you want so the total number of buttons 
is counting up with me one two three one on the click right there 
fire and sword accounts because it only does this so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven buttons let's see if that's what they say on the box because maybe I missed one but 
you know what they don't seem to say at all so thank you for checking out my obesity thirteen 
but blue that I figured it out this must also hard it has a tilting scroll wheel forgot about that so for on the side which I can reach easily even with my smaller hands 
three over here on the left which I can reach two of easily and there's a third one that I can reach but I'd be a little bit after that seven total eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen thank you for checking out my unboxing and first look at the G. seven hundred us from Logitech don't forget subscribe from one box interviews and other computer videos
