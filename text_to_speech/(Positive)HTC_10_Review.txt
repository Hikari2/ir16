this isn't a military career and exciting times here after floundering for a couple of years ago with phones that just weren't quite their flagship local HTC is back and this is the age teensy tense tell a beautiful 
metal casing hears over those who were creeped out by the glass on the Samsung galaxy ascendant family for example you've got that there snapdragon eight twenty CPU a very nice super LCD display finally we got huge the resolution in here lots of other good stock high end audio quality we're looking at now 
so the whole look of the phone is not unlike previous HTC M. problems like the M. eight M. nine but it's I would say improved 
we have obviously the dark gray models also available in silver depending on your country might get it others there's a pretty big chamfer it's more like a bevel on the backseat there I think gives it a more masculine and sturdy kind of like it's also a little bit more ergonomic for holding on to the phone your hand curves around this fairly thick phone more easily and you got a wider chamfer area to grip onto citizens that 
doesn't show fingerprints either 
new on the bottom here is a U. S. B. seaport and also 
outside there was a speaker grille will talk about that later 
here it is next to the one M. nine on the left I like that brushed stainless steel finish on the old mile but then again changes good right people are getting tired of the old age to see design boomsound speakers on the old one but not on the new until we have a fingerprint scanner on the front which will talk about tune that ties into a new speaker design with the boomsound hi fi edition in the HTC ten 
in terms of dimensions as you sow comparing this with the am nine the agency ten hasn't changed all that much is still relatively tall phone and let's put it next to the Samsung galaxy S. seven because as a similar screen size to get an idea what is nine humongous before and you know is a cheesy phone seemed like they were just awful lot bigger and anything else with the same screen size that's improved obviously I like I said for those of you who are afraid of glass on your phone in with the case now HTC is metal that will be little 
impossible to shatter obviously glass loom it could happen boomsound speakers on the front are gone and now we have boomsound hi fi edition what does that mean you have a tweeter in the earpiece story won't wait while you're at have against her ear and down here that is the woofers so it is not stereo sound anymore houses down compared to the the old HTC M. nine that had front facing boomsound speakers I kinda like the stereo speakers Barry got more sense of dimensionality this isn't bad audio in fact it's better than most phones it's more full and rich thanks to Wolfram newsreader being separated like that but 
yeah led the real important thing is the audio dak inside HTC as always had good audio on their phones and this time around about done themselves a twenty four bit audio dachshunds phenomenally have separate headphone and speaker amplifiers 
so we did is we loaded black player on here is one of many flak capable audio players and some twenty four bit tracks to test them out with a master and dynamic headphones those are very nice high end headphones and I can tell you that the sound wasn't moving when I played the eighteen twelve overture is something that if I'm listening to a good quality recording through big gear always brings tears to my eyes in did with this phone really really nice sound see audio files are going to enjoy this phone and also as a function where you can customize your headphone audio when you stick in a new set of wired headphones not Bluetooth ill actually have you set up a profile is the simple where there's listening through tones in both ears and set a custom down profile makes a little difference I don't know any it really probably helps between different sets of headphones and between different people honestly 
inside the HTC Ted is no slouch it's right up there with other flagships like the Samsung galaxy as seven the LG G. five and has the snapdragon eight twenty which is currently the latest and greatest CPU available from Qualcomm 
four gigs of ram thirty two gigs of storage and is augmented with an SD card slot that's on the side on one side you have your own nano sim card slot knows how your micro SD card slot open with your usual mt bench paper clip on the included poquito 
and that's 
an interesting interesting thing here because you can use the expandable extendable internal storage months I can reformat the card and treat it like an extension of internal storage for those news android phones you know it's kind of a pain to try to figure out what apps you can put on the SD card which ones you can some hints and make it so that's why with marshmallows featured supporting this you can actually stop worrying about that which is pretty darn nice 
the HTC intention be available on most major carriers around the well here is a strange thing in the United States Osaka T. mobile Verizon sprint of stepped up to the plate and said yeah we're going to have it but he teensy hers and so what we have here is the unlocked addition from age you see they'll sell directly on from their website for six ninety nine is compatible with a TNT and him all about to get all the LTE band goodness all that sort of thing 
by the way what we have here is several weeks pre release of the device so add things may actually improve like battery life which hasn't impressed me too much we get to that anyway and for a product that is three weeks before Easter so it's behaving well and it works on eighteen see we are using an eighteen eighteen some on this but so far eighteen and he has not said they will carry it in theirs doors 
the online price again is six ninety nine has well have to wait and see how each carrier prices it now summer Mirza said that they got some high rez 
or your bugs in the box ours was sealed us and direct one HTC to us for review and it had the U. S. B. C. charger so that's a quick charge Vito charter in the box number HTC making you buy that separately and the USB cable required to China but we didn't have any high rez nearby to hear someone show it's going on that one 
it comes to benchmark solid benchmarks pretty much like other phones with the snapdragon eight twenty which is to say very well you can see forty six thousand five seventy three on our quadrant score 
the treaty marked the sling shot tested twenty one forty five for ice storm is going twenty two thousand nine sixty seven not so different from the galaxy S. seven a little bit behind the LG G. five 
and it did best of all onto to beating out its buddies when one hundred thirty eight thousand five hundred and nine first score and author of a benchmark comparison graphs you can see but they're all pretty much neck in neck these phones 
now does the phone get hot I there was a problem with the last generation HTC flagship on it gets warm both the screen now you can feel it is 
friendly and warm and the back but it doesn't get burning hot I mean even playing games it does not get burning hot but it does get a little bit warmer cassette even the screen 
another first for HTC M. putting on parity with the android phones it competes with we have eight Q. HD twenty five sixty by fourteen forty display here this is a super LCD five and you know HCR is because their displays super LCDs not animal and so it's not a quite is singing as the Samsung galaxy S. seven family but still very nice and has a vivid mode and in essence RGB mode so vivid mode really has wide color gamut sRGB brings it down to a hundred percent well sRGB obviously which is still pretty wide it's a good looking display right it's not I seemingly bright it is adequately right the auto brightness feature on it works pretty well it doesn't air towards being too damn this is cladding gorilla glass and the edges are current so it gives it a nice looking as well there 
it still has tapped awake so if you turn it on 
you can 
do that to 
wake up the screen and there it is that you just wanna see your notifications and time that sort of thing much battery you have left their work and then we have the fingerprint scanner which works as well as the latest iPhones it really is good I find it the best of the android phones are fucked in part I think it helps because it is in the front so you can see where you're putting your finger much as it might seem handy to have your hand back here to touch that you you can't receive your centering on the backside with the nexus sixty or the LG G. five to have it on the back so I'll take it there cause if it's laying on the desk in just one unlock and take a look at something you don't have to pick it up and 
place your finger there do you some good job agency 
reception and call quality on the phone are excellent back unlocked version here has better single string then turned to DB than most eighteen T. branded phones go figure in a world where the radio chipsets are pretty much the same in all of these funds and all sorts of certifications are done the same way across the board I'm surprised but it is actually a good reception opponents ironic and all carries it eighteen to the one who hasn't said they're gonna 
selling yet but maybe they will say that 
the software here android six auto marshmallow currently the latest and greatest that is until android and comes out at some point you know how it is with Andrew there's always something there but HTC has been one of the quickest at updating software on their phone so I have pretty good hopes for that this is how they have their home towards their usual up and down thing with the black background you can customize the view it comes said over the couple of colors and may or may not make sense to you can of course change outside alphabetical order whenever 
on screen again since it's such a light and pleasant interface and they just do a good job here so I've actually enjoy the phone and I forgot what life was like when you don't have Simpson touch was everywhere be so many Samsung phones on the market that we were being that we see a lot a touch with them 
BlinkFeed is still here and still okay some people like it some people don't you don't have to use it if you don't like it you got news feeds you can put your social media here 
all that sort of thing so it you know if you're stuck in the grocery you and you just need something to do I suppose is pretty handy I've 
multiple home screens all normal stuff right there self software it's nice who want to get the settings we have this local in the of the fast ball so you got 
a wide variety of settings right there if you wish and then this is with the full settings screens look like right here you got HTC theming going on which is colonizing customize a look at the phone as well 
so HTC cameras they kind of were one of the problems that HTC phones for the last couple generations when they're doing things like four megapixel equivalent ultra pixel cameras on the back and everybody else was going through the megapixel race to the top in terms of numbers that wasn't so good well now we have seen a match of the resolution of the iPhone six S. and the Samsung galaxy S. and we have a twelve megapixel camera it's no they call ultra pixel camera and you know a lot about the manufacturers who actually joined in not calling it that but using larger sensor site so it's better for low light got your two tone flashier we have laser autofocus autofocus Quaker when you see our core four K. video 
that has our cat moving in as usual zippy Spiegel see how good the autofocus is ominous M. even more interestingly the five megapixel camera front here has optical image stabilization so does the rerun and we've seen that on the on better camera phones but the front that's a new one so when you're drunk at the bar and trying to take selfie is of yourself it'll help you out now the camera can shoot four K. video at thirty frames per second on the rear ten EDP on the front and the twelve megapixel resolution is only available if you're shooting four by three I know some you Hey four by three seeking to drug counseling nine megapixels if you want to do a sixteen by nine widescreen interface pretty symbol is your phone about if you wanna search the video right there switching front to back camera HDR is automatic on this you get your flash control and if you want more settings including Zoe Zoe is still here panorama pro mode for manual settings and all that sort of thing you got it right there you got your timer 
you mean the located where the tops it's a good job there and the most important thing here is the image processing is much improved HTC M. eight and nine had pretty mediocre image processing this one does a great job we're going to look at some sample photos and video next you can see 
so here are sample photos in a variety of lighting situations again idea of the camera overall obviously good lighting here handled reflections on the car nicely this is low lighting this is a beautiful photo the color of his eyes really shows through their 
and the flowers we see the typical magenta bloom that camera phones they do that 
that said the bloom isn't that bad you can still see the detail in the flower petals and overall it's a very sharp nicely balanced photo 
and the pool shot here shows how it handles reflections at a variety of colors and textures pretty good detail here it doesn't look artifact or Jaggi in the leaves which is good for a camera phone 
lastly even lower light are hammy cat here he is on his back very dark here Lotta detail you can see the fur and the wrinkles in the blanket 
and here's a sample four K. video at thirty frames per second obviously down sample to match a tentative P. resolution of our you tube video and this shows how good the focus is it's keeping up with the cat who never stops moving I and 
the colors and the detail there also shot in low light and Tenchi so you could see how that does quite good so I'm impressed with this camera 
no HTC claims up to two day battery life with this and what really light used as possible I mean that's also possible with an iPhone successor Samsung galaxy S. seventy hardly use it over the weekend 
I enjoyed does and marshmallows six going on does help so you can have excellent stand by far the most any android phone now running that version the three thousand Millie and Andrea here that's an ample saw that there's nothing wrong with that but I don't know if it's been kinda radic for us and again we are in the middle of April this is not coming until beginning of may there could be some tweaks and softener improve that it does have a couple of heavy duty power saving modes should you really need to ask for your hunting cabin in the woods fares are chasing anyone it's on the last you know but under normal mode here is sometimes it's been good sometimes as train quickly since there's no real rhyme or reason for that I mean obviously from playing asphalt eight expect the battery to go quickly but sometimes just doing everyday average things like checking my calendar and email 
I have been room 
so so far for me it makes it from the beginning to the end of the day just 
ereli and I'm going to hold off on screen on time judgments and and all that sort of thing until we get final firmware so in our written review I'll be updating that as the days and months 
house and begin a new song from their anything like that I will update the battery life section 
so the HTC tan is up against some pretty stiff competition Samsung's really finally got it right with the galaxy as seven families are on the iPhone success and six as plus well they they speak for themselves as well but you know the the the and the agency can does not have one single stand out feature that sets it apart it's kind of the perfect storm just getting everything right this time for those of you who do prefer a metal body far like HTC software better maybe you had migrated to LG or Samsung for awhile because the the HTC answer is wasn't quite all there for you this time it is that you get that really nice user interface you get a good solid build quality get metal which is pretty darn trust you get a really good counter that's quite competitive with the competition they see run on this table here and is just as fast to it like any SmackDown be sure to include that in the comments we can make it happen 
so there is the HTC intended is a lovely phone finally agency is back and I think they've given us what we want to hear still a lovely metal casing on a 
as to how you feel about the design that's up to you but I think it's perfectly fine nice durable doesn't show fingerprints to HQ HD super LCD five despite very nice as well audio quality 
antacids camera quality very very good and finally we have something like a normal camera from HTC and better camera software in terms of the image processing 
it's a very nice blue
