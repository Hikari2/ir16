Jay's video is the 
the request 
view on the 
how it 
video with 
I do you have to be careful what I say 
easy shins and I me 
I'm going to explain to you 
why I think 
with 
some facts 
%HESITATION that you are more than welcome to look at yourself I will leave everything as well and I talk about link below if you love more fee I'm I'm very happy to hear that I I mean that's fantastic I personally don't I've had very poor experience with a customer service number one I'm and the quality of their products 
I will touch on in a minute here but I just want to get that way because I know I'm gonna get people telling me that they're the best quality that they had phenomenal customer service that their brushes are fantastic 
that's your opinion this is my well I don't mean to ruffle anybody's feathers it's you know personal preference before I start this off on for any of you guys are where I work in BG product manufacturing on the professional side of this industry so I have a pretty good knowledge of it first before I get into this review I want to explain what private labeling as I and I need to explain that she'll understand how this is going to come full circle what private labeling is and I will leave the definition below as well that you can reference if you'd like 
is when the larger companies that own their own factories produce small we call them runs of products 
for a company with their name on it so lets you something like the blood drive are you guys are familiar with them they make I'll show picture here they hop out to their own blow dryers 
and their line of hair care products out blow dry bar started as a blow dry bar service and now they've come out with their own line you don't make their own blow dryers the private label of them off a very well known company in what probably will means status 
I mean 
bio ionic 
I've been on the blow dryer it says bluedrekar her drive are on their 
they do that for brand recognition and people now all I love going in getting my hair below now at this place let me get all the products they have 
I mean they do that because they can market up even more and there's more margin there for them 
I mean 
if you think the blow drive our owns a factory that's 
designing and putting together these blow dryers now the same holds true for you know benefit bar I'm that does all the waxing and they also have the makeup line for or a couple years back now they were trying to private label all the waxing supplies that they had 
and they're waxing bar they wanted it to all say benefit on their they wanted the applicator sissy benefit the waxy benefit it's a very very common practice not illegal 
I am the bread the companies themselves know they're doing it would be one thing if I bought a bunch 
lore mercy lip glosses and rob the name off and then you know put 
I mean I call on there and that's illegal but if I went to our mercy and said Hey can you produce all these in in place of your name put my name on there and he 
color the cap 
it's I mean I doubt Laura mercy does out but a lot of other companies do disarm I work again %HESITATION mostly in the professional hair and 
now outside of the industry we have some brushes that bio I onyx 
if you're familiar with the square brush that cost some people call it a square around brushy not square 
there is one factory in China that owns the patent on that brush so all the brushes that you see that are like that bio ionic come from that exact same factory bio ionic charges in arming a leg for there is because their name is on it 
I'm I have a manufacturer that puts out the same brushes because they have a contract with that factory in China to put him out for literally almost half of what bio ionic charges 
but again it's a perceived value you're paying for that name even though necessarily that name is not making a product a lot of products are made overseas in China 
if it's made in China that doesn't mean that they necessarily do animal testing if it's sold in China the Chinese government requires third party animal testing so something's just being produced in China because the labor costs are low out factory costs are low then they ship them over here and they're not being sold in China and they still claim to be 
cruelty free there is the possibility that that's obviously still true so I bought these for more he pallets to review for you guys 
the first part I got was a Jacqueline hill feverish Palin 
now that Jacqueline hill favorites pallets Thomas show a picture right here you can still buy those shadows individually because to the Abbasid my understanding this is the only power that we're Jacqueline picked her favorite individuals and they put this and a pallet the other one since they've kind of learned their lesson like always better not do yes and now they don't list the names of them and they say they are different 
how different I don't know but 
just to be made aware of that so if you missed out on this palette I will show the picture here and I will also link it I'll post the picture on my Instagram as well as Facebook and link you guys there so you can see all the exact shadows if you ever wanted to ask you can buy the individuals and put it together yourself so when I first picked this up I was at I mats New York and twenty fifteen 
twenty twenty fifteen 
yeah twenty fifteen I got this because so many people were raving about it I'm I had never heard of this brand 
I stood in this absurdly long line to get my hands on this and when I got and I opened it up even though I saw it on 
Thoresen things that never quite put them together until I pick this up and I felt 
this palette has little to no weight on it and this very similar thirty five shadow layout also started to notice with my next purchase back the silk screening on these pulses different where here you can see this one says mark he brushes and this one just as morphine other ones that I buy say again morphine patches on their 
I'm I'm down another market brushes one lap times what happens is when they're making a run of products like if I call up the company and I tell them I need ten thousand pieces of this particular product and I need it rush they may cut corners such jazz not screening on the brushes part tonight also cuts out costs rakes that's less ink used so that's why those variations of pallets could exist but I've noticed that 
that was my first sign that they don't own their own factory because it would be a consistent product and you know it wouldn't be like oh we're just gonna silkscreen this top on and not the bottom this time it wouldn't be that it would be a stencil that was done all the time go that was my first time like okay that's a little odd 
now 
I'm gonna tell you guys how you can always check these things yourself and be an informed consumer 
morphine every support their ingredients on their website it was only on the back of the box 
as a recently they do put the ingredients on there I will link your below you guys can highlight those ingredients 
and copy that and tight and just paste it directly into Google and hit enter and every product that has the same ingredients is going to pop up I'm sometimes maybe if one is missing out hot you know won't be in bold print but you know it's not identical with will show you the ones that share similar formulas so I'm going to use the example of crown brash and when a link their information below guys I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with them they do you they've been in business for thirty plus years making makeup brushes as well as Micah they do on their own factory and try not they've been around for a very long time 
they also are international they do a lot of private labeling 
for companies meaning that they won't put their name crown brush on the brush they'll play whoever else is name such as morphine threat here I just opened up a brand new brush roll from crown and when to show you justice sample does a crown brush 
take a look at on wifey brush they have the same kind of Caroline here are %HESITATION that quality of hair feels the same which is scratchy town has been private labeling they have it on their website a link that below that you can see out what their requirements are they have to 
I'm dollar Stanfield's means ill stamp Cooper's name on here so I wanted to get a brush that by them 
pick out my favorites and stamp Stephanie Nicole on here I can do that so say I go to crown brush they have requirements I believe they have a twenty four piece minimum for each piece 
that you want obviously the more you buy the less Kossoff I want twenty four these brushes and see that their five dollars they might given to me for four dollars and I don't know if I've sent 
I think each brush right so that gives me that small little window 
to make a profit 
on my site or you can even market up depending on what kind of following you have which 
cloud you have a five million YouTube are showing this down everyone's throat 
then there's a perceived value and that's right out of selling piece by piece by piece of I say Hey I want ten thousand of these but instead of paying I don't know five dollars a brush I wanna pay two dollars and fifty cents 
when they're selling in that kind of balk that could be very worth it to them because they don't have to worry about nickel and diming carry their one customer that might buy twenty dollars or thirty dollars 
selling in Balkan moving product like that again is beneficial to them 
so if I buy something like ten thousand pieces maybe and I can say instead of five dollars I wanna pay 
three fifty now my my margin increases or or what actually got me thinking about this first of all was the fact of the first thing I buy from them worries a couple of these brushes 
I noticed that when I was reading their website because I I'm kind of a weird al and I like to read a lot of stuff I like to know one buying from my Latino ingredients I'd like to know frequently asked questions but you know what other people are asking 
was on the site one day and I was reading there frequently asked questions and I will show a picture of it right here they asked on people said if my brush starts at the scene is it still the same brush now you notice all more fees brushes and they have different specialty collections now it's like the gunmetal SG but the original like these more he brushes are am and then a number 
well crown brush does that very same thing and not all of their brushes are numbered numbered but it would say see and then a number will more fees brushes all you see see and then a number 
now see doesn't stand for make up brush obviously doesn't stand for more iffy so what would it stand for 
I'm thinking crown I'm thinking crown made their brushes and in the beginning when they weren't realizing how big that they would get they just kept 
same numbers in order to it like that that's also less silk screening so less of a cost involved so then I saw that they change that which is very smart of them because now they're using different brush numbers and different lettering I was my first time 
the second one is 
when I picked up these eyeshadow palettes here is a more fee eyeshadow palette 
and here's a crown eye shadow palette agreement the layouts aren't the same the colors are going to be identical in here because 
if crown is making their eye shadows 
Murphy still picks what mix they want them and if that makes sense to this is so this is the thirty five color neutral eyeshadow palette by crown 
and this pilot is thirty five and which is supposedly stands for neutral 
I'm Marty 
now I want to show you 
first of all the crown I shadows are cheaper than the is this when you get a mere west so how they save costs to make more profit is they get rid of the mir you know the packaging is a little more flimsy and then they just mark it up slightly so obviously this packaging that comes with the two little brushes here and the mayor is going to cost more than us at the same exact amount of product 
a lot of the colors in palace to pallet are identical they don't have names so I can't say a hundred percent for sure and if I go through a swatch every single I mean it's a ton 
I'm not making this video to are not more he or anybody that likes it I just want people to know because there is there is a value in these pilots if it's that you like to follow along with makeup tutorials if you like to follow along with make up tutorials or see your favorite youtuber dual looking you want to copy them step by step thing it might be of value to you to keep buying directly from morphine because they do you put them in their own order 
and mix 
and all of that if your make up artist or you know you're younger and you just enjoy playing with your make up you don't care I recommend that you save a few dollars get about our power hit the mirror I'm buy directly from the source and then you can do all your own locks you don't have to worry about falling step by step though just out of curiosity I highlighted the ingredients and I went in search on them 
I have taken note so I wanna make sure I I touch on everything so more fee Sedona lease makeup artist network of fellow face 
almost identical to coastal center are a few different ingredients 
Allie express must have cosmetics made in China dot com 
all have the exact same formulations of these 
I shadows that are in these palettes 
their individual shadows do you have a slightly different formula and to be fair they just came out with a new a luxury eye shadow 
our premium one Ainge those ingredients are slightly different 
so they might be making their own products now or attempting to the part that I find odd is that 
when I've seen some of the reviews are actually kind of saying they don't like the new individual ones they like these better which would be saying they don't like the ones that they've made their like these 
I don't own any of the individual shadows so I can't speak to those and intelligently I can just go based on their formula Michelle yellow price break down on the screen right here now of 
each brand what pallets they offer them and what your cost per shadow is and cost program so you can just kind of wrap your head around that as well as the cost per pallet because you can see that other ones are significantly less expensive if you like some of the more he brushes I may I suggest that you check out crowns sin though brushes as well as their studio pros they actually also have a gun metal collection that's sold in a kit lake that's 
%HESITATION I will link all of that stuff below it's not that people are cheating if you think about the cost involved in making a product and even machining okay you would have to own your own factory that's going to get all these pieces parts are machine I can put all the hair together and the Farrell and pinch hitting glue it imprinted 
it's a huge cost undertaking so a lot of companies start out private labeling they're branded as they get more recognition not when the branch off 
and start using that money they've made an investing to come up with their own formulations and 
their own factories which again that that takes a very long time unless you get some serious investors behind you so this morphine pilot was twenty two ninety nine and this crown palette with same amount of product with a better I'm packaging with the mir and the two brushes for cents cheaper coming in at twenty two ninety five kind offers free shipping at a hundred and fifty dollars or then it goes based on weight sold more pouts you order if it gets heavier you do have to pay shipping and I can get expensive more he offers free shipping at a hundred dollars the first ingredients on all of these because they're the exact same order the exact same formulation the exact same eyeshadows Iraq mineral oil and tell he's also do contain parabens 
I wanna link some information below for you guys I'm the internet as an awesome place for information also can create a world where no aura I'll have you know web endear is in people that will freak out about things parabens are actually a very affective preservative against bacteria 
I mean there are people that have sensitivity to them I'm not a doctor I'm not here to offer that kind of guidance for you so I'm going to link articles below some that will tell you they're safe and some that will tell you they're dangerous read up for yourself and make your own informed decision don't fall into that mass hysteria that people like 
a kind of perpetuate mineral oil for people with oily skin and sensitive skin and can cause real issue on your eyelids and also clog supporters talc Israel very inexpensive Feller but in all fairness my VCR palettes are talc I'm as well as the dean Tasha do known a palette that I just recently bought has talc as a first ingredient most shadows made overseas and Italy and France their first ingredient typically is tell I do not like any company that I'm directed to deal social media I waited almost two or three months for my order I'm and 
I was aware it was going to be sometime 
I am up before I got it because a pre ordered the thirty five I'll palate but I didn't think it was going to take ninety days while I was watching everybody else get their stuff they said they had ordered after me for that palette that was annoying when you email them no one answers when you call and no one would answer 
I'm really busy or no one would answer and so you are always dry 
media which I don't like 
I don't think that any of the YouTubers that I'm recommend these products have the faintest idea of where things are made or by whom that's typically not something across a lot of people's minds 
the only reason I know that is because I do work on the side of the industry so I'm more aware when I first started my job and unlike private labeling lies that we try to see if you've got things where some of these more he brushes became calm all the value is for me to be a professional makeup artists and starting out to you sometimes need cheaper at natural hair bristles because you're going to be cleaning them all the time do you think I'm gonna stick my hundred eighty dollar she Kyoto brash and alcohol be solution consul you clean 
now you're out of your mind so something like this that I can spend I don't know ten dollars for use a bunch of times disinfectant and then tossed it away my new one when I need that then 
again there are some good things about this line I just figure why buy from a middle man and pay more when you can buy directly from the source again is it going to say I'm five ten on there now is going to see see five ten on there now you'll just have to look at what the description is on the website an example show you is that I see four seven three crown contour brush let's put that up next to the morphine and four five nine 
there I pretty much identical brushes 
I do not find that the shadows performed while there's a few and these Murphy pallets that can have a decent color payout I might find the shimmering ones are slightly better this pilot I find to be overall kind of garbage 
I'm at their thirty five I'll have some pretty colors and their knees Orangemen's can be okay some of the showers I find a lot of these Browns to muddy up inflate right off my I 
I do find it comical when you find when you see any see make up artists 
are people I need to giving you know 
hundred dollar Tom Ford brushes into you know sixty five cent eyeshadows so when people are swearing by the things I remember guys people get affiliate codes again affiliate links 
do you think that you're going to sell more twenty two dollar pallets or more eighty dollar busier pallets 
you know it's a numbers game so it's typically you have a wider reach of your audience when you recommend something like this that almost anybody can afford her something like an ear hundred dollar balance find a lot of these early Pouteria really ex hockey feeling I get I think out of all the pallets the two best songs are this thirty five all and the Japanese cult favorites the pads in the grip that you have on your finger when your swatching a shadow and wiping out with some pressure onto your hand is not going to be the same color payout that you're going to get on your eye with a brush 
some of these when I swore on a swatch in my hand I think all that 
that's decent but if you write back and forth a little bit to kind of like simulia how he'd be blending it out it's like 
it's gotten it looks like a feat 
remnants of some kind of color but it's nothing very true young can you make those shadows work yes can you make those brushes work yes I have had a few of the brushes that I no longer have because I found them away that 
after one wash 
the Farrell has come completely off I'm well aware of how to wash my brushes I know not to get water in them this entire thing came off 
Farrell broke off on one of them I 
more than half the harrowing one just chunk right off 
I mean 
the names tend to rub off on here because it's not hot stamped it's just %HESITATION like kind like a silk screening so you can take a clear nail Polish if you whine paint that over there and I'll make it so it lasts a little longer I find needs to be super scratchy 
and let me explain it like this funny first give you guys a little information to you on on something like a natural hair brush Aptos say these are all the same type of hair because I don't typically 
have any dark Gulf which I think this is a goat 
these two are both blue squirrel and say that they are all from the same animal season say these are all go all the hair has been gathered okay 
just like when it comes to sushi or state they are going to take the bastard group of the hair extensions same thing they're going to take the finest softest most uniform to group of hair and they're going to offer it to the highest bidder say someone like she Kyoto who make incredibly soft and luxurious precious 
so 
the best hair goes to them and say somebody like lingas comes and in his brushes are super luxurious and soft to 
he wants a batch for head so then he gets another one and something maybe like a hockey auto once of batch something with them and then the left over at the scratchy some sketchy hair will go on tour brush that's less expensive something like Murphy and these brushes typically have been died to give them some uniformity throughout the hair and that's why you will feel that scratchy feeling because it's not from the softest part of the call it's from the part of the cult that no one else wanted 
have you guys aren't where the difference between natural synthetic hair brushes I will link my video below where you guys can see that so when I was just act the west coast buying conference I got my updated beauty store business magazine that's trade magazine for anybody that's in the professional beauty industry 
I'm right on the cover I'm aware the brother and sister of morphine 
and if you notice it's hash tag morphine brushes behind its remarkable success 
it's basically talks a lot and the article about sleeping so much excess utilizing social media and influence 
the main part right here says get a glimpse into anymore he brushes co owners Linda and Chris toe will I think is how you can also last name utilize innovative strategies and social media to effectively revolutionize the media business 
I didn you guys know ID I sound maybe a little condescending I don't mean to you I just have a real problem with social media brands that I don't think earning on their own merit that basically just show a bunch of crap down our throats and expect us to take it IE 
I just I don't like it I think their customer service leaves something to be desired 
I got there I shuttles breakdown tool a pretty inexpensive cost still if that's in your budget then you can definitely make these work 
so say when you buy this palette that 
not all the shadows and here are terrible say she had a thirty five 
fifteen of them are good that settling up your cost of the price per shadow right and that's even a fifteen are going to magazines very overly high estimate you know I looked up on you tube and kind of all over and I have not seen one bad review about Murphy 
not one 
I can't find any 
so again this is just my two cents guys I just want you guys to be aware because I feel like literally when I bought the is I was like oh my god these are going to be the best thing ever and I'm on my way is this what the hell is this 
that's all I pretty much have to say about this brand guys I'm if you guys have any questions or comments or concerns please even the commissary and down below and I will do my best to answer them thank you so much for tuning and guys and I will see you next time
